  is the right type? The answer is yes, but I wonder where a certain class of people are interested in them? Perhaps they are interested in this kind of thing, that is, as a class of people who are also interested in it. Or perhaps there are a certain class of people that just want the right kind of place. That are interested in it, and that is the right kind of place to settle. But as it is in some ways a very different class of people, I don't know when the right place is. I know that I am in an entirely different class, and that class is quite young. I don't know where that is. There are a lot of people with that kind of people with a desire to live and work in this kind of world. If someone were to move around and move as much as he could, maybe a great house in this kind of world would be built in it. But that is not what they are seeking. I doubt whether that person is one who is interested in this kind of country. If he were, who is the person, what would he do? He would have to do what he is doing right. I don't know. That is one of the problems with what I am trying to do. If I were to want to get rid of all this matter, I could use the money there. So that is my problem. I mean that I am here, I am a farmer now, I am in the kitchen. There is nobody that I could have been doing more good for myself, or who would have given more to me. What would have happened if I had kept doing what I was doing? I would have been so much better off if I didn't keep doing things right, and that is the problem. But it is not clear that it is the right way to do things. I would like to know. Of course, if you asked me how I feel about a situation where I have been involved in it, there would have been a very different answer. Maybe we can help each other. So then what is the problem? Why are you interested in this place? Then it seems to me that nobody is making any demands at all. If you can get some people out of this country, you don't have to work very hard. You just get a job, whatever, and that is what this country is about. Then what will the country look like? What will you do. All I have to say is: I wonder how we all might be able to help each other.<|endoftext|>The world's most powerful bank is using this time to help the world's best athletes get better at football, as seen in the video below where a player in Brazil is asked to take a knee in front of another player. While this has a nice amount of attention on video, what really goes on in Brazil isn't as well known.

A year ago, the world's most powerful bank, the World Rugby Union of Brazil was already trying to get a few players to play in their respective sports. The goal of the program was to see if the world's most powerful and well-known athlete was good enough to be named as the World's Most Important Footballer. It certainly was not.

While one might question the merits of that effort, there were two ways to get players and teams that represented that country's best. One way, was to see just how much the athletes and teams looked like the men and women who wore uniforms on their jersey. The other, was to use a different approach. So we asked our readers, who helped shape the world's most populous sports league and the most prestigious sport in the world, who would come up with the most famous words. Here are their words and the answers to your question.

Famous for their size, the most famous sports leagues and sporting organizations in the world.

One of my favorite words is "flamboyant." The Flemish fandoms, of course. The fandoms are also known for using very small heads.

If you watch this video, you will see a pair of big, big heads. The fandoms have really big heads. You will also see the fandoms with beautiful arms. They have tiny shoulders. As I read this, one of the fandoms' shoulders was very big. The fandoms also have a small chin.

This is a funny thing to say. One team, for example, looked like they were about the size of men's bobsleds. The other team, which was about the size of men's tennis, looked like they had too much hair. Some of the fandoms and the other fandoms have big shoulders. The size was also very small. So, it was not a big deal.

They said, "They're a bit short." Then we added the word "bobbles" or "bubbly." That was very clever.

 was even more curious than usual to see the little beast. But as he did not speak the word and was so perplexed that he had to give each word off as truth, we had to carry him out on his way. His horse and the little man quickly got off. So we rode with him. He was very good-natured to one side, and with good feeling said that he would never again take our cross; and so we took the cross of the little beast out of the way, and when we arrived he sat and ate at his own table, and so we got rid of him without any trouble, till the hour was dawn. But he seemed to not eat for a time, and at the appointed hour he said: "Come, come, and have some more of this, that it may be eaten in the morning." Then came the cross to him, and said: "Give it to me, and I will eat it." Then we took off, and the little beast ate our cross without trouble, and so we went out with him and took it. He then took off the cross, and did as he liked. However, for the first time, he ate the cross, and it ate at night, and it still ate at this time, till then he wore a cloak over their heads, and carried the cross, and ate a little piece of the ground that he had left on top of it, and so he went along with his horses, with his eyes open all the way, and with one ear closed, and with a second one of his own, and so we rode fast along; and at the appointed time it would turn into a mountain, and go to bed, but if he did not sleep, he would be asleep, and so we were very happy, for he had to take a little bit of it with him, and we had to carry it through the evening. Then we took a little piece of the ground, and we took off our cross, and the old man ate the cross for an hour, and the horse then took it out of the way, and the old fool was the first to eat it, and then we rode as fast as we could, and carried it through the afternoon, and slept till late one o'clock. So it was as if we were going to sleep, and when we awoke, our horses and the little beast ate their supper at the appointed hour, and the old man was the first to go up into the sky, and eat a loaf of bread, and we ate it. So we rode along with them, to the end of the mountain, thinking: "This is our night, and all is lost, now let us sleep on our journey home." Soon after that we went away, and we took the little beast out of the way, and slept with him in the night. But our horse was the first to take our cross back, and after our journey home, we took his cross to eat again, and slept long, and took off our cross, when we came to twilight. At the appointed time the old man took the cross and took off our cross, and when we awoke he ate at his own table, till the hour was dawn. But he seemed to not eat this very long time, and when we came for the cross we slept on the ground, but he never ate it. Then we took the cross out of the way, and we followed him until dawn. We took off his cross in the morning, and when we were about midnight he took him away; and at the appointed time he took his cross, and we went on our way to a far country, where, when we were about midnight we came to a great cave, with a great number of animals and one or two strange beasts sitting on it. As he sat there at night, watching for his prey, he said: "You know that I am a man who, sitting on a tree above a stream, has not stopped, which means that I am not looking at water to drink, and I have neither the time nor the body to swim, which means I am a poor man who does not pay attention, and I have no money, which means that I am not thinking of anything to eat, which means that I am a poor man that does not care for something, and I do not care for anything to drink, which means that I am a poor man that does not care for something that is not of his body, which means that I am not feeling anything in my head to drink, and I have no idea how much money this rich man has, and he has nothing to drink." Therefore he said to the others, "You tell me your own opinion, then you all are mistaken, and that I am a poor person." So they said to him, "Then it means you don't need to know, that you know this, and that my opinion is my own." So they said to him, "You tell me that my opinion and mine is mine,

Cow on to the deck. The young fellows got to the top and sat down. A little fish in a basket and a big cat, the big cat. 

"You must give up your sword and bow," said the boy for a moment with a grimace. 

"No such thing as that," said the fish. "They are just your comrades." 

"If not you, then it is not true," said the little cat, raising a little paw at the fish. "I am a fellow, you know I am not a fellow; but why would I try?" 

"This is very ill-treating," replied the fish, "and you are a fellow." 

Now all the fellows sat down down next to each other. 

"We will eat tea and biscuits," said the fish, "and there will be a little bit of tea." They started to walk at once, and at each other a light breeze blew, and they walked till the little fish stood at a little corner of the street to see one of the fellows with his eyes closed and his hand wrapped to one side by a thick scarf on the way, and a thin ribbon hung from one end of the scarf on a little chain of thin rope of silk, and the fish and the little cat followed suit. When they were gone the big cat stopped for a little while at a small house in a poor wood and sat down beside an old woodcutter, who was very old and who liked to laugh, and the old man thought there was some way in, he was sitting there with his big eye on the young fellows. 

Then, with a long sigh, he said to them all: "Tell me, how should I get away from this old house?" 

The fish smiled and said to the old man: "I will go to a little cottage with a stone for the young fellows to sit and eat tea. Tell me, how should I get away out of this old house?" 

The old man said that he would get away by a little step, but his foot would be at a great distance from him, so he set down a little stone in his pocket, and, when he finished, walked to the cottage again. He thought of some way out, and asked the little fish where he could get out of the house. 

The young fellows looked with astonishment at the man who was standing there in a very dirty house, with the stone of which they had seen nothing, and thought no one could carry out the task. Yet the man said of themselves: "I can get away by a little step." A little stone in his pocket and a little foot for the young fellows; but they could not get away till they got a little step to the cottage. Then they sat down beside a little tree and ate tea at the same time. 

At the same time a stone of a little stone came into the cottage as they walked, and the man was thinking a little bit, he wanted to know the little stone, but his foot would be at a large distance from the little man, so he took a little stone into his pocket and put it on the back of his head, and walked on the little man; and, when he came to a little house, with little stairs and a stone that he had never seen, all the young fellows thought he was going back, they all sat down with a little stone, and the little man said: "Tell me, how should I get away out of this house?" 

The water ran up the little tree, and the man thought: "This tree will only bring comfort to some old fellows. But in the name of good fortune it will bring peace to the others; so the old fellows must know that they owe me a debt, that one has to pay." 

And when the man got home, he put the stone in his pocket, lifted up the little man, and walked on the little man. And he thought: "If I had given that old man my horse to have carried a little stone into my pocket, I could have saved myself from my burden." 

As the old man went on with his task, his mind began, and he thought back to his old adventures, all his days, all his nights. He did not want to talk about the little stone that was in the pocket, or that did not contain a little stone of this sort of stone. He thought his own heart would be as glad as his horse. He remembered that he had never been back in his old adventures, but now his journey was begun. He had to think long and hard the little stone: for he now knew the little man and his task. 

One day the little man came to a little window and said: "I saw this little hole in the ground; and the little one behind the window was sitting there staring with his head in the dark

 as more time is given. 

The next morning at breakfast, Muddy was lying down by the wood, in his garden. $Hero was a great gentleman by this time; but in the middle of the afternoon a very strange creature arose in the forest which the $Villain was very sorry to awaken. 

The thought entered his mind immediately; he never knew that the creature had come from the forest and was just a small child, but he knew that there must have been some kind of thing that had come out of the forest, and that it must come with great danger. And then it was not long before the $Villain looked at the child and said, 

"You can tell me the animal; for its mother is in peril, for while it grows, it has the kind of power that only a small child can possess. Tell me the creature. It seems to me that there ought to be something in it that will not hurt or frighten; and if its mother does not die, for she will be able to find the food again and help her to live on as if she had never been in the forest. I have not done anything as cruel as that; but what more I dare say, tell me, whence it comes." 

"You will tell me that you know," said the child. "It does not look like any thing that I have thought of. I have thought about it quite an hour ago; for I have seen little creatures like some of the $Villains; they are almost like children. There are two of them in my garden, and all of them look as if he was a tree. It appears as though they were about to die; but they will live long enough, for they are able to eat anything and can be grown again. In the meantime, when I have finished speaking, I shall have dinner with the $Villain and the $Villain's friends, but I will never, ever tell them anything about it." 

The child said nothing; she only wished that she could say something. 

"Do you want to tell them?" said the $Villain. 

"I am going to call them," said the $Villain. "But they have the power to know what I think of it. If they wish to tell it, I have got it from a tree that is near them; but they can also see what is behind it, if you will help me." 

With this the $Villain said, 

"Let the Tree tell me," 

"The tree is about to die; but you must be careful." 

The $Villain said to her friends, as they were in the forest, that if she did not go out with the young child, they would die. 

"And the child?" said the $Villain. "Do you think it is safe to leave the child here? Would you give my child the right to fly with that tree?" 

"I believe not," said a little girl; she could not help seeing that this was nothing but an awful task. She said that she had made a promise for $Hero, saying that she would not let anyone get on her back and have no part in her death. $Hero thought and did not say anything to her friends; she did not speak to them, and she was so very afraid of the little girl, that when she had gone out to the tree she did not dare to fly again. 

"So you can't fly with the little girl at all; let me know the cause," said the $Villain. 

But the child did not say anything. 

"If I should die," said the $Villain, "I should be sorry for you." 

"You mean you would not have to be afraid?" replied the little girl. "When I think I have grown the strength to fly off into the forest, which is my hope, nothing will ever be able to help me in that fight; but perhaps I should die. If you go out there in the forest, you should go through the bush so that the whole earth has an impression of you like a bird." 

"What is this thing," said the $Villain, "that I have done?" 

And the little girl said, 

"It is a small bird that is quite young. It flies as usual. And if I do not take it off at all, there will be no harm done. If only it were that young, you may never get the fright you were so afraid of." 

This little girl went through the bush quite like a bird: she would not move; and then she said to the trees, 

"If I do not go out there, let me tell you a little something!" 

And the forest in which the little girl was living was

 said the father. "Do you want to be our judge, or do you want to be our captain?" "I like that," said the boy. "Let me go, and he wants to try that." When they returned to their room, the father and the mother sat down opposite to one another, and cried out, "O dear little girl, who is the fairest one to run our hands in this court-yard for the sake of a boy like you who is our judge, and wants to be our captain?" 

"He will let him!" said the father, taking the boy in his arms and gently lifting him beside him. 

"Oh, so beautiful!" cried the mother, "and so dear to me, dear little girl!" The boy came into the court-yard, and was sitting on the bench beside the father of his sister, who was watching, with the mother who was staring, as if in ecstasy, with the heart of tears. She had to lift him and stand beside her to keep him, but she was unable to do so, so the father took the boy away, and laid himself up beside her. The mother, in an agony, cried out, "Oh, my child, my dear baby! my god! my child! oh so beautiful! my dear little girl! my darling child, my darling little girl! my dear little girl!" 

"Oh, my child! my darling little girl!" said the father. "Letting him come into the court-yard, you know, is not a good thing at the earliest, but by the third day, he will do it. Let it have its way. Let it have its way, and so do I!" 

So the father pulled the boy under a bush, so that each one of them moved into the yard and sat down beside him, in a very gentle and loving and pleasant sleep. The mother, after hearing these words, went over to the father to see if his sister was asleep, and then sat down beside him, and said, "O dear little girl!" 

"He will come into your court-yard," said the mother, so as to keep him out of the room for the sake of the child. The father, as this had been his way of doing things of late, thought that the little girl should be in the yard, and would not come in, but went off for her own life and would not be in the court-yard. She had to be kept where the court-yard was and in the yard by means of an iron-clamp. But that was so much more difficult. So she took his name and made him $P$$$$$, then took his father's name and made him $$P$$$$, and so on. 

By the second day of the third week, the father awoke by putting up the iron-clamp; and when he had put his hair all over it, it was a very heavy one. He looked at his wife, with one eye opened, and said, "I am so angry, that I cannot say a word; for I want to see a judge." 

He looked at his daughter, and said, "I want to watch a judge." 

He looked at the maiden, and said, "I want to see a judge." "Yes," said she, "you could have gone into the court-yard for the sake of the maiden, but you can't have gone in." In her heart, she was so deeply in love with the father that she felt not only that she should not have been there, but that she should have gone into her father's court-yard all in the day, just as the maiden did. 

"Then," he went on, "the maiden would have been very angry; as her heart must have been so deeply in love with that father, she must have done her duty in the court-yard in a little while, and never made it through." 

So her mother and the maiden met, and the maiden asked, "Will you watch a judge?" 

"I can't," answered her father. 

"He was never in the court-yard?" cried the maiden. 

So she was taken to the court-yard, and sat in a chamber, which the maiden had. There she sat in the same way, with the maiden and the maiden, until midnight when they were very near, in the morning she had given birth; and by their birth she had been a son, and was to remain a son long beyond. 

"So," he said, "this is my daughter to follow me; she was so very lovely to me in that time; I never knew her to be so beautiful or so beautiful in her eyes. Her hair came into it, and she had to take it. I would not put it off

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 the day he made it to the top on his broom and fell asleep. 

The following morning he walked to a house where he was about to take his leave of his wife, when the door suddenly opened and he saw a pair of white foxes approaching through. 

"Where are you looking for?" asked the fox who was looking out over the country. 

"My wife and I are coming from another country," answered he. "I am just about to leave and to go to her!" 

"It is going to be very costly to hire her!" repeated the fox, and he went on his way to a bank, where he was to hold his wife and the two of them became very friendly. 

The fox told him that although he would not go to his wife and leave her as he had promised, he would take her for his companion. 

So he took her down to the bank, and said goodbye to her and rode off to his cottage on his broom. 

When he returned to his cottage he found the fox standing next to a small fire. 

"Well, you are all right then!" he said. "It is a very nice day and I did not know it, for the trees are not yet growing. The forest is now very green and I feel very happy and well-wisher for both of you, for you have a great fortune." 

The fox then set the broom on fire, and he began to tell tales of his adventures. The stories made him look for both his wife and the two of them. 

"All right, now," said he, "let us set out on our own journeys to each other." 

"We are to go on our own journeys to each other," said the two foxes. 

"We will," pleaded the third time and the next. "We will go on our own journeys back into the forest." 

"We shall be back to you in a very long time," said the third time. 

"How long?" asked the last time. 

"A long time. I have been waiting for you for the next six months, and I will give you your present as I am going to leave her for the rest of your lives. I have been waiting for you for two years, and I will give you all the present you desire, as your present. You have a very special gift in the world. You can be a dog that can come and eat you alive. If only you would give you one penny more." 

"I suppose that is the most natural thing for the animal," agreed the third time; "but I beg your pardon for saying that no matter what you are doing, you must be very careful with these things." 

"I ought to have done that. If I was to make you pay, it is because I have been doing it. And I am very pleased that you have done it. When has it been your day? When can you tell me where it happened?" 

"It has happened. I was traveling on my own journey from one end of the forest to the other, so I would have done anything. You have no doubt that it was my little girl who came to me, and I cannot imagine that I did not know that a dog or two can come and eat you alive." 

For a long time the three foxes were the only animals that took the two of them as guests. When they awoke in the evening and found that they had been out for several days, they would take their own lives in an instant, but if they were to take the dogs and cats that had been eating them, they would be burnt to the ground. 

The next day the three foxes were sitting in a very large room on two and one-half acres, where, for the first time, one could feel himself getting older and more beautiful. 

That night it took them two weeks to reach the farm where they had first left out of their way, and by the time they got back to their cottage their little cottage-house was ready for them again. 

For three weeks thereafter their lives depended on a few things. First, they were to live in peace between themselves, in peace with their dogs, in peace with their cats, in peace with the house where they had lived for a long time, and in peace with the land of England. Then, of course, the last was to take a wife and bear her children for another month. 

The six months passed without them ever having to be out to the farm again, and it came as a huge shock to find that as soon as the six months passed without them, their $Place had disappeared from their memory. 

When the children came home from school it was obvious that every time a $Villain came home, he would

For a moment, and then he paused. His face was flushed, he seemed to be saying something, and before he could think, he felt my hand; and I began to walk. I kissed my forehead, and I touched it so well that no one could find fault with it. But the longer we drove on, my mouth began to grow heavy, and I could no longer move. It was all but white, like a snow-white bed, with little stars on it, to be seen in the distance; and I could not find any way to get out of it, for I had never had any rest since the first week before; I had become dizzy, I was falling asleep, I had become a little dog, with its ears stuck out. I couldn't say what it was, but I could tell it was quite a dog; but I could not move. I could not find any way to walk, because I lay there and stared at me the whole week. For a moment I did not feel as if I should run away; then the snow-white carpet came down into me. Now, instead of trying to move, I felt very thirsty, and my head felt as though it should be wet and thirsty, but it felt warm and soft, and my head was only like some kind of thing with big eyes. I did not stop. I did not move; I just sat there, and gazed at the dog. I wanted to run away, but the dog ran and came to me, looking down at my head and saying, "Where are you going, little man? What did you do to me so easily?" I could not ask if it was because of how fast I was running away or because of what sort of dog I was. So I said to myself, "Well, if you are going to be able to get away from me, why not get something else for you? You must run away from me now. You must stop running, and then we can both go on running." But all that went away. Now, I am not really able to walk. I cannot even run, because I cannot hear anymore; I can only look and run away. In another hour or two, at first it was too hot to walk; and we continued on running, and we could stand just as the day was hanging by the wood: but then I was frightened, and came to think that I was going to run away; and a little while after I would have come running; but I could only run away now and again. I did not stop. I could not get off the bed; I could not find any way to get out of it. I was quite thirsty; and the dog was just like some kind of things, with big eyes, big noses, big legs, and big feet; and I thought to myself, "I can't get back to the bed again, I can't get back to the world if I were still. Well, I shall run. Run; run to the window. Go back to the dog." And it began running, and then it stopped; the dog moved; I ran back to the window, and the window fluttered a little; and now nothing but dried air, and dried mud, and dried flies, and dried birds, and dried flies. I stood still, so long was the interval. No one could see how long I should have been running; but once I was quite sure; then it ran off again, and I was so thirsty that I could no longer walk. I could not get back any more. I could not walk from the door to the window; I was tired and thirsty too. Now I think I might have made my way there, but the dog was just like some kind of thing, with the big eyes, big noses, big feet, and big feet. And I thought it was the least of all, for I ran faster and faster. Now, I am still running; I can look and run, but I cannot run. I cannot run, because I cannot hear anymore; I can only run to the window; there was no better way to get out of it. I think I must go; if there is still to be run away from me, I shall run." "Are you running away?" my child asked, "Where? Now!" Again, I thought, "Well, maybe there is something, and I think to myself, "What is it?" Now, I think I shall have run after the dog, for I thought to myself, "I shall have run after the dog." "Where, now, are you running away?" "That is good enough now, but if you do not run now, a little time will come and we shall have to run." But I stopped running. "What a good time I am running! Where are you running away?" "Just run. Run. I have ran far and wide, and I'm tired, and thirsty too; I can only run to the

 no, no. I was looking at him like some kind of idiot, and he didn't look at me at all. Then I said: "That's great now; I'll take care of this." 

'Oh, I'm glad I don't remember any of myself, I'll just do it. That's why I'm so glad I don't remember anybody.' 

She sat on a stool with her eyes upon the table for a while, and then she said:

'Ah, how great that's been to me. I remember the night that I ate such a huge meal with myself. I don't remember. I guess it's like my life. I'm lucky I didn't lose my wife. I don't think I want to have that happen again.' 

And yet the next day she sat in the corner alone with her eyes on the floor; for at one time no one spoke to her. She had to go out and walk round it a hundred times. Sometimes, after walking round twice, some gentleman would come looking at her, but she didn't speak to him. After a while he came again, and told her where she must go and how she must stay. So she went to the door, put her hands to her body, and said, 'There I am.' 

'If you want it, you can put it,' said he. The other fellow followed her as he walked; she felt a little ashamed of herself. So he brought off the head of the fork and shook it. At the end he let go of the fork; and a woman came up to her and fetched her. 

'I'm sorry to see you, poor girl,' said she, and shook her head. 'I have to look after myself. But that wasn't the way I was going to do it. I couldn't stand up all night, and I had to walk round and round as if the person who had come with him was sitting down.' 

'Oh, you must have noticed?' said she. 'We have to be pretty.' She went out to the door, put her hands to her body, and set her foot on the stone-stone. Her hands trembled a little, and after she went the other way she stood still as she spoke again. It was very sad and very strange. She was very well contented with her new life. She went up to a table and said to a lady, sitting in front of her, 'What does this matter? Have you put in your hair or your legs? Or perhaps you'll have an easy escape to be able to eat like a good little little dog!' 

She stood looking up with her eyes closed, and then she put up her hands to her body, and said: 

'I don't know what I should do.' 

'Well, that's not fair,' said the lady. 'I guess you're just as sure that you haven't heard, isn't you?' 

'I suppose what I should do is to ask for a letter,' the other lady said. 

'Dear Sir, don't you know how I'm going to get back to Mr. Burns?' she asked. 

'Oh, yes, I know. There's a letter in the papers from the tailor, and it's a very nice letter. I don't believe I should take any heed of it now, but I am so glad I didn't have the $Helper to carry it to our meeting,' the lady said very quietly. 

'What does that matter to you?' said the $Helper, and she was all the wiser for an honest reason. 

'You know I can't stand to hear you say anything about it,' the other Lady said. 

'Why, Sir, I think you know it's a very good idea.' 

'Yes, a very good idea. But you also don't think so of the $Helper, and yet I want you to put your face in it again.' 

'Oh, why not,' said the lady; 'I don't think I'll have anything to drink. You know when it's evening and you wish you were a little old to go into the village and have something to drink, there's a letter with a beautiful lady with a great head and a wonderful face and just as sweet as a cat on a hot day. I don't want my dear Miss Burns to say anything about it.' 

'That'll probably get me into trouble,' she said, 'so here's your letter,' and she threw the letter under the table. 

'I'm going to get out and do something for my $Helper,' the other said, and she went back in. 

'Well, there's a letter from the tailor who says that he's carrying your letter to us. It's not

 not. And yet she had a mind of her own, and she didn't know why it was called, even in their time, 'the woman.' It was never a great difficulty to have her; the only difficulty was that the $Helper had not the slightest inclination of seeing that any one might have an opinion. Her husband was, however, of a good inclination and one that had no difficulty giving it to her. 

And yet she would not allow his eyes to fall on her again, because, even in his heart, his feelings for her always seemed to him to be very strong. 

At last the children called out, and the mother and father looked in each other's eyes and gave each other a laugh. “Oh, dear mother, your mind is just in the midst of this, but you are all alone now!” “Yes, dear child, you must be!” the mother's face was white like the face of his own child; but on closer examination the child was quite different. In their eyes were the same things and with the same impressions. No longer could the mother's eyes have been able to see a child; as her eyes were still more accustomed to a child, the child was not the same as it was before the days of the mother. As she looked back at her daughter, her eyes had a strange and very beautiful quality to them. “Oh child!” she had said very very slowly and almost to herself, “I would not have wanted to give my daughter away,” and, as she looked at the child, she was very glad for its coming. “No,” she remembered, “but if that was all that would have been of advantage,” she thought. “But there are all the best children when they are not children.” “That is a truth,” said the child. “And it is not my duty to give my daughter away now,” and “That we should!” “Oh,” said the mother: “I don't feel the need for this. I was just a child. But now it is that I should have given my daughter away. I must have thought to myself,” and the child was glad. “If I were not in charge,” said the mother. “I could not have wished my own daughter away,” and in that the child cried out: “Mother, mother, mother!” and in the mother's voice the child cried out: “Mother, mother! Mother, Mother! Mother, mother!” And in her heart she still cried. She was very sorry her dear little thing was not a child, but very proud and, for the first time, very sorrowful of heart. The little child had a deep sense of that, and knew that his parents held a great power to him, and that their children were good men, no doubt. And, indeed, he knew exactly that that was so, but even there, it was as if there were only one thing to be expected. “Oh, dear boy!” he cried, “I look to the child now.” “Yes,” said the child. “I will do my best.” “There is no more to be expected!” said the mother. “Let us go, mother,” the child said in her heart. “No,” said the mother, “I will not leave the child.” “It is not now.” “Oh,” said the child, “that is an order.” “It would be foolish to let it go,” said the mother. “The child now is in his cradle, I suppose.” The little child made a big smile; he could not have hoped the family was a mother, for he thought it was strange that a person so beautiful ought so great a power. He gave it the big smile. “But, now!” cried his mother at the same time as the child, “I will make myself very glad about this.” The mother looked at it quite as she thought of her son's mother. “So it is!” cried the little child; “I must have thought of it one day,” and she was very glad to take it down. “Don’t disturb my child,” she said. The child did not think any longer about it but still saw the mother of the child. He understood how happy his mother might be and that he should not trouble her. “We can go together.” The child went on in the morning, though not a step at night. This night was beautiful. “Yes,” he cried; “he has

 all a thing for. I'm thinking of spending some money in her business as soon as I can. I've never seen anyone so happy in my life as one so happy from the beginning. She is not so much a lover as a beautiful woman. 

'Don't worry if you do manage to get her, for she is all right with an old girl. One day he, too, will bring her a flower so beautiful that he will make us all a happy man.' 

That evening the girl ran to Mrs. Smith's home, sat down in the room, and picked a box. Nothing at the door was more delightful than the flowers; and the little girl did not even think to look about her. But the door opened, and the little girl was seated on it. 

'My dear,' she said cheerfully, 'I didn't know you would be coming. I know it is just what you like. Come in, don't look at me; don't look at me. Come in.' 

The girl sat down the box, and, with a little bit of joy, took her to the kitchen; when, when the young woman took her to her bed and kissed her, she was alone with her beautiful life. 

'Ah, but what would we have had if we had not been so lucky?' She cried bitterly; for then it might have been easier to be the little girl whom she wanted to be with. 'You must have been so lucky that I was so lucky. But it should have been otherwise. The old woman gave you her old clothes, and you are going to change them for me. She will do that for you. You won't be the only one to do this. I have a young, handsome $Villain that shall go for you.' 

What was it about the $Villain that the girl was so anxious about? 'Poor, old, young girl,' she said to herself, 'they are so happy! They must be going to the sun and not to the clouds. She has a beautiful girl.' And the tears, the tears, were falling from all the tears in the world; and the tears were not falling from the $Villain, who loved her, but rather, they were flowing down from Mrs. Smith. 

This beautiful old woman had always married a $Villain, and had given her the beautiful dresses as a boy, at the age of eight, and the flowers as a girl. 

'Poor child,' she said, 'they are so hard to change; they must want so much as a dress. You will give them a dress for the sun; and then they will be so happy. You can see them all on the grass, and see them all when they are gone. When I was just a little girl, I could look over your legs and see all that was on them; but as a little girl you never can see all it is.' 

The girl thought of the $Villain: and the tears, the tears, were falling from all the eyes of the world. The young, handsome young woman had her dress changed for her, of course, as soon as she should be married, and if she did want a dress, it would give her a little more to wear. Now, it was all for her. She had a lovely child: it was very lucky to have it. 

An hour went on and on during the year, and the old women came in the morning and told her what their business they had decided upon. 

'Let the little $Villain, $Villain, $Villain and the beautiful $Villain go for you,' she said. 

This was the youngest one of the lot, and yet she was very glad to see him; but her heart felt as it were ready to give in to every suggestion that a beautiful and beautiful person could desire for her. 

Mrs. Smith was quite delighted. She told the girl how much she was grateful; how much she was content with it. 

She was glad to have been married, even by her own will; but she could never get over the old woman, who seemed so happy and kind in the world, and to know that he could do for her what she should do for a $Villain. She remembered her old life, in which she had always been so good and kind to her dear $Helper; but to make her happy, and to enjoy the life of a $Villain, she had to make herself better, and she could not, in this old life, do it. 

She was still a little child, and would soon be a $Villain. She was not very happy to get it done, as was much the case of the old woman, but, when she got up, as she got to sleep, she could think of Mrs. Smith as a $Placed

. Once I had made a little table, I began to talk to the other children. "That is my room," I said; "and I must be ready to tell them anything they want." But not a word came of the conversation; only a dull murmur of a laugh. I made a small stone, and made a little fire, until that was quite extinguished, and it was as you would expect from a young man. I said: "Your master must not wish to destroy a pretty little house, because you must never let one grow old and go unlettered!" and then went on talking as usual until I lost no time in getting off for my room. 

Then, having taken up some work in the forest, I went to the castle, and there I was welcomed with open arms. Upon entering the castle I found a small palace, which was splendidly furnished; it was so very large that I could not help thinking that all the palace's contents were beautiful and made of very fine marble. I did not know, however, how great the riches of the castle lay, but it was a large and rich one that stood close by to the palace. It was covered with many beautiful jewels and gold, and had three rooms, one with a table and a stone; this part was a beautiful palace, and I never saw such fine things as the first room. At one time a good man, who had been at the palace in a very long time, was to be expected there upon the opening of every one of the rooms. But, alas! he did not come, and wept over every one of the treasures in the palace; all the treasures being so beautiful and so magnificent that we could never have considered them to be real money; even though some of them were made of so fine a fine marble. 

Once upon a time there was a poor man who knew nothing but the things that were in his house; and when he came to the palace he found a little stone and said, "Placed there by a great magician, is a little stone very beautiful and very beautiful." And he did not know what to say; but he went out to the court-room and said "Places such as this are quite beautiful; but it is very very dangerous to look at them; there is a very great one out there" before he went away to the court-room. This advice had just come to me, and I took it to heart, as I was very much obliged to give advice to those who sought guidance or assistance from God. 

When I was again at the palace a good old man said to me: "My good man, we shall see how much money there is in the palace. If we do not see it well, then it must be destroyed, so that we may have another castle." So I set out immediately for the other side; and the man who had come down from the court-room, who had been waiting for me, said to me: "Who are you waiting for, my dear?" And I said: "My best friend!" "What!" said he "what's your name?" My good man said: "Oh, my boy, it's my friend Dolly, so I say, you must make haste, for you should never know what I'm doing." I gave him away; but the old man did not want to be deceived again; so he gave me the stone, and I said, "Places like this are quite beautiful; but it is not to be seen well, I must be protected from the dangers." So he went out to the court-room that the old man who had come down had gone off to tell me his name. When the old man had finished his speech, I set out at once in the other direction, and came up and stood at his feet, and had no more conversation than that. But once upon a time there was a little boy who had a horse that were very poor. And on the twelfth day he came out to the court-room, and said, "Places such as this are quite beautiful; but they are guarded from the danger." So he took out two of the horses; and all the children, at this day and night, were pretty much as if they had never been seen. 

When the old man had thus done his speech, one of his companions came by and told me his name, and asked me whether I had met any one who had seen such as little as little. I told them of the horses and of those whom they had not met; and they said "Well, I don't know, perhaps you must wish to be more careful of them; they are not to be seen, for it is quite too early in the year. It will be in vain, though it is a beautiful day, to come in the week." And that is all I said to this companion. 

I knew nothing of the horses but their shape,

 me, and that was why I could not have married him anymore. So, when she got tired of him, she begged him to let her stay with her and he agreed to it. One year old Lily took care of her. There was no more time for her and she was quite happy with herself. As soon as she could no longer sit by the fire, she gave her life to the little cat. 

When Lily and Lily were married, they said they had something to give to their little child. They had a new home, a new way of looking at the world, and Lily did most of the things that she knew Lily did well. She worked hard to make sure that the cat lived on every corner, and she played with the little cat all day long. When the little cat got tired of her work, she gave up everything, and the cat was not happy with her. 

She wanted something that was good to be able to live in, so she took Lily as a companion and put her in her bed to rest. After a while the cat came out, and Lily felt sorry for herself and was happy again. But, the cat was not happy with her. Every day she cried bitterly, and at night she sat over and rubbed the little cat's skin in her sleep. 

When Lily and Lily had been married, they knew that they had something to give her. They were now going to have a good time together. When they returned home after work, they saw the old cat and her little cat sitting around a fire. Lily saw them and said to the fire's owner, "Is there nothing there?" They replied, "Where was you going that day?" And the owner responded: "I was just here to tell him that I was going away from home and he couldn't go away." 

When Lily and the cat went home and thought about what they had done, they all wanted to keep their secret. They thought they could not go out alone or for long, and they took their clothes off, covered them, and ran to the fire where they had brought the little cat and the little cat. When they saw what they had found, they all ran out and ran to the house to fetch it. This was before the time of the cat's maiden year, so they didn't sleep that night, and the cat came up to them and said, "I am to come and see you for a while when you are going to cook for me, but I want you to get dressed." So they all went out, and the old cat dressed herself and went to take a nap. 

When they were gone, the old cat came over to them and said: "I am going to see you for a while first, but I want you to take me for one of the new catchers." So the cat went home and took a bath to herself, and she went with the cat to a little table and sat in it. Then the old cat gave her some food and said: "Take a bed-cover, and when you are all out, give me this blanket and make me to eat all my food." So the cat sat on this bed, and said: {You may have to use a bed-cover; it will not stay in your bed, it will cut off the sun out of the window, and when you are done eating, you will fall asleep asleep under the blanket. How does it work?" So the cat took the cover in hand, covered her, and put it on. When the cat sat down on one, she put the other on with her. They sat there and listened, and the old cat put her first in, followed by her second. 

Once, on the last day of the week, the old cat came over to the little cat and said to her: "Get ready, you cat, I think you will be better off now if you have a little bed in your little room by yourself, and I will go into it as soon as I can. I will put my head out. You must take your pillow and have a little blanket under it. Then you can come in and sleep peacefully in your little bed like a little cat did in the old days!" 

She knew that the old cat was right, and so she went into the room and sat on it, and when she was ready to go out, she put her head out and went to the window. When she closed the window, the old cat came over and said: "Come to me, take your pillow and see what will happen." 

She could not bring herself to leave her little cat, so she set out in the direction of the house which she came in the morning, and she went into the forest. In the evening, however, her little cat came in the forest and said: "Come to me, take your pillow and sit in it. I will have you a little better than you did just now.

My father told his brothers that they would have the victory over the enemy as soon as their $Hero was in the way. It was now, to tell the truth, that he said he would not leave his horse and mother, but that he had not to go to war with the enemy, who was well mounted for combat by his horses. 

“There are three brothers who have a $MagicalObject, and one has a knife in his right hand, and the two in his left.” 

“It is to be a good match; and if there be a good match, that one will come to me.” 

A month after the battle, my sister and I were separated, and the $Villain asked my father to grant him the command. 

“I will give it if you will only grant me one; not to see the fight, but to hear our thoughts.” 

And the second time they were separated, and my father gave up his horse and mother, and rode away in the back of his troop. 

A great many miles round the castle, and on one side of the road it had long since been repaired. The $Villain was very tired, and was not far off when I thought, “I may be on duty now to-venge the $MagicalObject which I have stolen from the $Villain, or else I will break his foot and have him run off,” and said, “If you wish, and if you wish, I will do it no less than what the $Villain wishes,” and his horse began as though he wanted to go on, and he said, “Ah, well,” and ran off with his horse. The $Villain, who had heard the stories of the little $MagicalObject, was greatly surprised, for he thought he had gone too far to the $Villain. But at last he asked him to give him a wish, and when the $Villain saw him, he said: “Who is your $Hero?” 

“I have only one,” said the $Villain; “but I cannot be less than it was when the first thing happened.” 

When his little horse reached him, and the three men stood in two rows, they began to say in kind that they would ride in the other row on their own; but he said that he could not refuse, and they all gave him their money. They were all of age and had no need for money. 

The $Villain was a man of a great heart, and his little horse had been killed by the enemy. When they had asked him what had happened to the $Villain, he told them that $Villain had been slain in his sleep, and he said that they would be sure of his life, and that he would give them their money for a thousand years. But if they were a race of robbers, and would not give him anything for their life, they should make the first appearance, and be carried into great numbers. So they rode on and on, till they made it clear not to have any more money than they had left behind. 

Then they all turned to the $Villain, and said: “The Knights should have a large body of horse to ride upon, but not so thick and strong as that of this little $MagicalObject.” 

Then the great crowd went on the third-row, and at last the little horse mounted his own horse and mounted the crowd, but the second did not get the chance of getting a look at by the Knights, and the $Villain gave a great shout: “Now, give your money to whoever is in the best shape so as to get the Knight upon the wheel.” 

“What do I wish for?” said the $Villain,  and there was so much talk that they came to stand by their horses. Some said they would ride in two rows, but they all turned to their own little horses, with such fast legs, that they did not fare a whit about. Once when the second of these people came knocking, they began to say to each other in a kind of a very high-pitched voice: “Who are you?” Then the little man turned his back, and said: “I am the good man of $Villain's money, for I have not left $Hero.” 

“Then,” answered the other two, “what did you think of us?” 

Then they turned around together with the rest of the crowd, and asked the little man if they would ride on one of these two great

 him.’ “Then, you fool.’ 

And they put each other to, and then the other, after a time, put their horses to the other as well. And when they were all going to the feast, he sat on a high chair between them, so that they might see how his chariot was sitting, and how he sat on a horse’s back. So the horse came running after him, and stood by the side of the gate, and said with all his might, “Good-bye, my guest, and welcome to the castle!’ And then they all went back to the door and sat down, and the two chariotmen who rode out to the door, and called with their voices to each other, and kissed each other on the lips and said, “We’ll go to the castle,’ and then the horses came over the front door. 

And so, though they had been so far gone, yet they still sat and waited to see how he would come along, and so the two chariotmen gave each other the horse, and said, “Good-bye, my guest, and welcome to the castle!’ And then the horse went again to the baron, and said, “Good-bye, my guest.’ To them every one came, and the baron was his son, and all, and had been sitting there, and when the Baron and the horse saw what was going on they all sat and looked at him, and did not know what to say. And, when he heard the baron speak, his father and mother said, “Good-bye, my guest,’ and he answered, “Good-bye, my guest,’ and they all rode home together, and it is the castle I should like to visit first.’ And the horse rode till he ran away and was gone. 

At last, when it was dark, he heard the Baron go by, and so he went away, and at last ran on and passed up the stairs, and he came to the baron’s castle and said, “Good-bye, my guest.’ The baron went back and said, “Good-bye, my guest, and we’ll come to the castle,’ and the horses came over the front door. 

The Barons, who had been busy making merry and merry, had got ready for the wedding at seven. One day the bride-groom came and showed him the wedding dress which the guests wore. “” So the bridegroom said to the baron, “Good-day, bride, or you’d be married,’ and rode away. The bridegroom, too, rode at the feast to the wedding, and took a feast-table. The baron and the servants looked very glad and salted his girdle to make himself look fresh again. The bridegroom went on all the way and gave the wedding dress, and the wedding-cakes, and ate them; so he said to the baron, “Good-morning,’ and went into the banquet hall, and knocked when the door was opened. The baron did not look kindly, but said, “Good-day, bride, or you’d be married,’ and rode back. The bridegroom went on all the way and gave the wedding dress, and the wedding-cakes, and ate the wedding dinner; so he said to the baron, “Good-morning, bride, or you’d be married,’ and rode away. The bridegroom passed on all the way; the baron knocked when the door was shut, and said, “Good-day, bride, or you’d be married again.’ The baron was so pleased with his son’s marriage, that he went and gave the bride-groom the gift of the wedding-cake. Then they all went to the wedding, and took the bride-groom in their arms. They were very merry and delighted about it when it came, and put on such good clothes that it was beautiful to look on them; but at first it was very cold at the door, for, having left it to the bridegroom, the servants had not let her go in nor out; but, coming in through the window, they all went in to see that she was there; and the baron asked where the bride-groom was. When they saw her she was on the bed crying, and said, “Good man! I saw her in the garden, and she’d be there when my father came and sat down to dinner.’ The servants, however, did not know her, but thought she was home in the

 the very notion that he was an "artist" had come into vogue. So it happened at a late hour that he had returned to Chicago, and was not home for the night, for he lived at his parents' house, and was unable to spend his leisure time. When he heard that there was something he thought was a play on the old adage of a man who has just had his 'go.' “He must have lost his mind,” thought he, “or else I am the man he thought he was when he got his 'go.'” " “Well, that's what my parents wanted!” said the little boy, “he had already lost his mind and thought he was the man he had just been talking about and had nothing else to have done. Now to the trouble was to see if it would all come around as it should without the play on the sentence. 

He had written the play on Sunday, and, in a month or two later, it went on to sell, and the play's fame, but not its success, made it more difficult for him to earn money. Now and again, he told himself to keep quiet, and at length he had got no further money. 

So on Sunday his friends and his mother would ride in a carriage about seven miles from his father�s; and after they had gone through the city, they came back home and sat down on the steps opposite his bed. $Donor was waiting on the roof, where his father kept a little old closet; but she said not much, and he sat by the window and did not see $Donor at all. “Why, my dear,” answered he, “I had a bad habit of being alone at once.” But when he came home that night, it was all forgotten. 

By the time he had left $Place and settled at his father�s house, he was tired, too, and his mother was still sleeping under the roof. But she did not mind; she had had her children. In the meantime, she was very tired; and although she had had nothing to do and was very much tired of it, $Donor had gone, and had looked as if he could go back to the day when no one had ever gone back out of the town and had never seen him. It was not long before $Donor made the best of the short break, and in a month or two they had moved to their new house. 

Once on a Sunday morning when the boys were coming back from school, $Donor could barely get away a step. “Where are you? Where are you going?” 

“The school is behind the house,” answered $Donor, who was not too busy, and thought: “I must go, if not. I ought to get on with it.” 

The door was only wide enough for a child of twelve, and when he saw his father and mother he was sure that the only child of its kind in the world looked like anything that could speak. It was all so much more, however, than that the mother and father could make him understand; he felt sure, even though he must have been pretty far off from the world, that he was not quite as beautiful as usual. For instance, it was so plain to him that he fancied that his mother still had the money in her pocket to buy some butter on the first day of the next class. It was as though in the air, he thought, that $Donor was not very much alive, and could not really relate his situation to $Donor, because not just $Donor, but everybody who could speak was alive and well. 

“I shall have to get out of the school,” it seemed, and, with no real plan or plan of escape, went to $Place. $Donor and $Donor, and everybody who couldn’t come out of the school. When she thought of the difficulty of putting together the school without a school, $Donor said: “Here is another way of getting into the school,” and then, on a cold gray Friday morning, she got out of the school to go to the store. There she met four strangers, who had been brought from the country, who walked up and down in the shop, and told the girls, 'Please hurry, as these ladies are afraid you might run off with them.' “Where’s $Donor?” said the $Donor, and they jumped up, they held a little boy close to their arms, and said, “$Donor! $Donor!” “$Donor!” exclaimed the $Donor, “what are you all about? Are you all in the school?” Now it

 time there wasn't one to be seen. 

'Oh, but you said the thing about the girl he had with him?' said the old lady. 

'Yes, yes, it wasn't he that he had with her; I think he was the woman who said he was gay, and if he hadn't known it then maybe he wouldn't have had the time of his life right now; but he knew who it was and how she met him and how it came about. She wanted to have him married so that the two of them could have a good marriage; but nobody in the world would believe it to her, and in the end nobody could.' 

The old lady looked across the room and at the old woman, and the old lady saw that the cat in the old woman's arms was, well, a cat herself. 

'What made you think this would be a good thing to do?' said the old woman. 

'Well, there was once when the oldest of my children had a very troubled mind; and when he went into school he came to school with a long-winded look in his eyes and a face of sadness on his face and a mouth full of words that nobody could ever understand; and he was so miserable, that the tears ran down his face, and the face was like a face of tears; and then he said “It must be so easy for you to be unhappy, to be unhappy in your life, to be unhappy in your family, to be unhappy in your children,” “and he said you don't know that if you wanted to change things up you would have said it to yourself, and didn't you?” 

So the kitten said his voice just the same as the old woman’s, and they met again at the church. 

'And that was really the end of it all,' said the old woman. 

'And, just so soon after that, when the church was turned into a cottage, I think they had to cut off the head and body, as I had ordered them to do, so that the child couldn’t grow up until he was sixty but then he would grow up without being old enough to hear what he said to himself.' 

The old woman sat up straight, and for a long while she thought that it was the cat in the first part of the cat’s arm or the old woman’s that were right and the old woman’s wrong and that the cats didn’t know it from their eyes. 

Then at last she thought: 

'Don’t you mean to say these were really the words you didn’t say to yourself before?” 

'They probably thought it was the cat who had him with her; but when she said that the kitten didn’t know it from his mother’s eyes, a good thing happened. I don’t know whether it was my mother's mind, or whether it was the fact that in the end all his fears were not so serious, he was a cat!' 

$Helper said nothing at all to the old lady; she thought only what $Helper had said to herself. 

Then she said: 

'So it happened that the $Helper was to marry the cat in his arms.' 

It happened that $Helper, and $Helper, and $Helper, went up to the church to see the church, and there was a small $Place in the garden about half a mile from the town. 

'And, $Helper,' said the old lady, 'all you old folks you’re so old you can't even remember what it was at that time, do you think that the girl you were with had the little old person now with you to marry the cat in her arms?' 

And $Helper said: 

'Well, well, I’ll never forget that! I mean, $Helper, I couldn’t have married him, it was so hard and time-consuming. All the things now in $Helper’s life were so different in their times, and they weren’t right but they were right! So $Helper, after all, was it ever my intention, in any way or form, to marry the cat?' 

'I’d like to think that my life was as happy as in it was a hundred years ago,' said the cat in a small voice. 

'Well, now you remember,' said the old lady, 'that it didn’t make a difference. I didn’t know.' 

And it happened that $Helper was really going to go to the church at the same time as $Helper. 

$Helper was looking about on the lawn and said

 do of you what you must do as I have made an effort.” “Be my guard.” But I can't do it.” “If you don't pay me,” said she, “I shall be forced to work for you. I can't bear it with,” and she gave him a bad laugh, “You know what? We are married, but neither of us is faithful.” 

“Oh,” cried she, “I shall never marry again!” “That's the great counsel for me; I am married; if I would, I'd do it!” “If I didn't tell you,” said she, so she went back without giving him money. 

“You know so?” said he. “I have always been so; but now I know all.” 

“It is well,” went she, “that I will bear what I want, and live my life happily.” 

“That was good for me.” 

“I'll keep fighting to live my life happily,” said he. “The more money I have, the sooner I shall find a wife. I shall find a wife,” said he, and carried his great-granddaughter into the garden. But her master had made many orders for her so long ago, that she must not work as hard for her own sake. When she was still quite grown, and was quite light, she had no trouble keeping up her master’s orders; but, being of a light weight, she still had more trouble getting on than being heavy to work for you?” 

“We must come and talk some more.” said the old man's daughter. “We are going to ask your master for orders to drive her to work, that she may do so in the garden.” 

“I cannot do it.” said she. “I have to drive her in the morning to work. My master will think you are not good enough for him.” 

“I dare say I am really so much heavier than the first one; he cannot bear it with,” said she. “$Place is dangerous! I should get hurt!” 

“Well, I could not save them,” said he. “But you can save them,” said she. “I won't take any of my masters counsel.” 

“There is no such thing as that: you're not my master,” said he very bitterly. “Look at what your master has already ordered, for I dare say you know nothing of things.” 

“The time I have,” she protested. “I would have the time of day” 

“I am afraid you don’t understand your words,” said the old man's daughter. “I had the time of day, and the hours are long, and every morning it is all but morning. You do not know anything at all, but I shall find out.” 

“I have done that,” said she, “and you have got to make up your mind why you do it. Otherwise, your master knows what it all means.” 

“Good luck!” said he. “You do not have to do anything! Don’t be afraid,” said he, throwing his great-grand-daughter through all the garden door. “I know nothing: you must be a fool to think otherwise.” 

“Very well!” said she, “but if you take your mind away, I suppose a thousand times you are mistaken.” 

“Then you are an old fool,” said he, and fell as if he would have broken one of his own. “And you shall be a thousand times an old fool!” 

“Yes, I will, though that is not right me!” 

“Do what you will,” she said, “but if I be no fool, it would not be so much to me as to be an old man.” 

“Well, my master must not be so foolish!” said she. “This is something very hard to do. I should be a thousand times a fool.” 

“What are you afraid of?” asked he. “You might be too afraid,” said she: “heavens, you know.”

 become the son-in-law of $Places. 

The youngest was not a man of intellect, but a man of the imagination and the mind. He was a man of the mind and, as you might guess, he was very curious. His first impulse was to see what other people looked like. 

He had come here through a window-sill, the windows of which were opened by a dog; but this was of a man of mind. If he were really a man of the imagination, but just what was there to discover in his own mind? 

He had thought of himself only as an eye in the window, of a man of the imagination, and of a man of the imagination. He came here, and with each step he made the same result as if he were moving through a space of a great city. 

It was difficult to find the world in this fashion. But then he came to the first door of the $Villain's great castle, and that was the most difficult door. He had always been a gardener and, besides that, had been an accomplished gardener. But his master was as strange to him as the walls and the ceiling. There, so to speak, was a space in the centre of an enormous castle, with an enormous bed at the middle, with round and round walls around it, and an enormous gate behind which were pillars of stones with the floor-top in the centre, and with a huge bed next to it, so that it was so light you could hardly see. 

To him there was such immense depth of feeling that his eyes opened, and a small, white finger with white stars came forward toward the door. The finger was the same as his eyes, there but for the small finger. The finger was so large, and so small, that he could not have touched it before it moved and said a word. 

And so forth followed the steps of the path by which he went. He felt like looking through some stone tunnel that led out to the forest. If he had not seen the bed, the floor or the ceiling, he would have liked to say the word "Creeper"; for he must have had some vision for it. 

The castle was so magnificent that $Prince was not at all frightened. He was only a little frightened when his master came, and he had a good laugh in the way it looked. There were two steps and a great hall and a little room full of things and people. 

The doors had a square head which was made out of a wood, and a small head which was made out of an iron or a ball-like structure which looked like a little chair in the air, and in which it had to be pushed forward with a weight, and then a great mirror fitted with a big, white mirror was rolled on, and in which it stood with the feet. Behind it there was a tiny chapel standing in a little chapel, and a small room was set up in the middle of which there was a table and a table with round plates on it. 

When the door opened the other way and $Prince entered, the room was so enormous that $Prince and the little child walked as though they were in a balloon to the sky. As they went they could no longer hear. They heard nothing but their tiny, round heads; and even the tiny things began to fly and go around and around, and when they came nearer to the roof and tried to take their forms, their heads began to appear and the little faces were as blue as ice! The little man stood, looking at their heads and the tiny man started. 

But nothing could hurt him. There were so many things there, and yet he couldn't stop. He climbed up a little ladder, and there as he was climbing he could see the ladder going down, and then he could feel the light of the ladder, and he could see a very tall, strong man standing next to the old man. He went with $Prince, and he felt as big and as large as $Prince. He could have only one head and one nose, and the other two were round like stars on his forehead. He was the tallest man he ever saw, and he was also the hardest to walk. 

Suddenly $Prince began to move. He went up one row of wooden steps, one at each end, and the path began to curve, and the ground became smooth, and as he went he felt as if he were walking on snow. He was so tiny he could not help looking at the old man, but there, at the feet of the old man, he looked like a boy from the age of three. He looked so old, of course, that he must have been born with the eyes of a girl, and he looked like a boy born in a foreign country. So they talked about the beautiful castle, the beautiful bed in the middle,

 vanished the earth and the moon, but she was unable to rise. This is why she thought she was going to die in vain. 

$Helper was not the kind to think of losing the soul of the person who was sleeping, so there he was, but she did not realize it. 

$MagicalObject sighed. 

"I knew that she would not die," she said. "If I lived the $Villain could not marry me unless he could obtain some other body that he might have. I knew she would not do a thing that was too bad for me; and I knew she would not like me. The $Villain would not be content to have her. He knows that, and knows it also very well." 

$Helper nodded. "All right, $MagicalObject," she said. "I may just as well give you the $Prince, for you are all yours. I might as well send him away and never see you again." She looked at $Helper, and said to him, "Dear $Helper: I know you cannot have $MagicalObject, for he has no name." 

"I am," $Helper said, "I knew it would never happen, but you can tell me the story of $MagicalObject." 

"Oh, yes! I know," said the $Helper. "I was very foolish to think it would happen." 

"Don't you think that $MagicalObject can help us solve the problems of the Kingdom?" said the $Hero. 

At the same instant $Helper said, "I was so foolish that I did not think of leaving him." 

"That was foolish. If I had been so foolish I should have left him. I am not a $Villain, $MagicalObject," said $Helper. 

$MagicalObject was a woman with red hair and a smile; she liked to be known as "Strawberry." She was so happy and confident about herself that she never gave reason to think she was a $Villain. When the $Prince went to fetch strawberries, she thought he had stolen them, and therefore no man or creature would be fit to have him around. The $Villain was not to be trusted, and not to let him have strawberries. 

"If I had $MagicalObject again I should have the same kind of a soul as when I was a child. Don't you know that?" she said to the $Villain. "You are an easy fellow; and you understand how the world works, when you are young enough to have such a soul. Why, you are an easy thing, aren't you? It is a matter of life and death. How is it to live without such a soul as that?" 

"If my heart was like mine, the only thing you would be would be another child." 

"If I were a tree like you, and one thing was impossible to live in, the $Prince would find no other way to live at all. He will have a mind, if he does not get it, to go into a bush or ditch and take up a little stick to hold it together. If a man did not get one, who was ever to come along, he would make a pit, and he would put it near the ground. But where is a bush where only a tree could run?" 

"Then it is not a bush at all, and that is just so." 

The $Prince grew up to be an easy fellow, and in spite of the hardships he had endured as a child he was able to make himself very agreeable and kind to other people. He never had a quarrel with anybody. People would say that he was a miser or a murderer, or both. He was a very friendly man to the $Hero. He was very kind, was always eager, and did not take trouble. He was not at all troubled, at times, but he always went home and lived on his own. At night he would leave one or two people behind him and go home and be quiet. They might all be thinking about where he had stayed, and not that he would mind, just as he had been thinking of the $Hero all year. 

"Well, $Helper, would you like to see a picture?" said the $Villain, looking at the book. "I will take it up quickly." 

"Oh, yes, $Helper! It will take me a long time," the $Villain said, and looked in the picture, which it took away and then in the mouth. It was very funny, but it is just enough for me. Go and try to picture it." 

"It is beautiful!" said the $Villain, "and, indeed, so easy! Here is the picture! It is full of the charm of

 seemed. “We should have been able to go out with a friend’s boy next or we’ll be stuck in the middle of a school.” The man laughed and said, “You’re right, we can’t come up with any reasonable excuse. We don’t go with anyone who wouldn’t be able to get out of our sight.” “Then the best we’ll say is, we oughtn’t to get out of our sight.” In the end the man was forced to admit that it was foolish of him to stay behind and wait for his own boy, for he had better have someone who could help him. As he was leaving the school, they ran after him, and when he came back he looked so strange that he didn’t know what to say. “Don’t you dare to come up with yourself any further, you should’t be thinking about your whole life.” The boy said, “I’ll leave you, but I’ll call on whoever you want.” “Then, what do you want? Who’s the one with the voice?” “I don’t care a soul who doesn’t know.” “Well, let you call me whatever you want. I’ll call myself A.’Thirst or B.—” “Ah, right.” “What can I say to you? I’ve been calling myself A.Thirst for five years. I thought I could come up with something else but after I did that, all that came back was a string of things I wasn’t able to think of. I was in debt, a credit, and I was out of work and couldn’t repay them. I’ve said it before, so you can’t come up with a satisfactory response from me.” “I’ve never said that! You have!” “It was a really difficult thing to have been able to have been able to have a sentence of sentences! This sentence of yours was one sentence! You were forced to have a situation where you had to come up with something to get your sentence of sentences off of and you couldn’t do anything!” At that moment all the sentences in the world suddenly came into being, and I felt it was not my duty to ask the boy about what happened. I was obliged to ask him exactly where he got his sentence off of. The man didn’t know about his plight that morning, but I thought that it was more difficult being stuck in the middle of a school, and it wasn’t long before he was able to talk. “This is such a tough thing to deal with!” he said, “A judge can only do what he wishes and then he’s never going to make the mistake of letting things pass at all. It’s just the way it is. It’s such a horrible world. I didn’t know that I could have this punishment for it now.” Finally, the man said, “You can't have things pass! We’ll have you stuck in the middle of a school again.” Before I knew it, he had arrived home in a big cardboard box and I was standing there and he had said something like, "This is so rough. I’ve got a bad headache right now.” I had had little trouble managing the headache, but I lost a good deal of sleep. “Where have you been? Are you here?” “It looks like I was here, but I went down to the bottom of the mountain, and I’ve got a bad headache.” “Oh, you’re down to the bottom,” the father said. “Well, whatever it was, it didn’t hurt much. And I guess I'll just have to make up my mind. Just keep going. You can’t have things pass!” My father was terribly discouraged. He had a feeling that I would not make the mistake of staying stuck at school and sitting down with the boy to talk. I had thought, "No, he’s not going to come. What about you?” But I had thought, "If I don’t give you advice, I can’t go to hell, and you wouldn’’t get saved." He was right in saying, "That’s my only advice. Just keep going." If he went off the mountain, I couldn’t get it back even if I were stuck. I had hoped he would tell me, but it was always so much harder to make the kind of decisions

 gold, and when two men came home, they asked the $Hero if he had been there and what had happened. ‘He promised me that if I would come and visit me, he would tell me what a lovely and wonderful man he really was.’ They took the woman’s necklace and gave it to her, and as he was looking at it, he made out that he had made a strange one and had bought a pair of it for her. He brought it with him and made out his name, as he had promised. The woman took the same piece of gold and handed it to him. Then she took off her spectacles and danced in front of the window, and they saw two $MagicalObject sitting on the ground, but nothing was seen of them. ‘You know nothing of the world,’ said the $Hero, ‘and nothing of what $MagicalObject has done.’ The woman went and took the piece of gold from the door of a $Villain’s castle. Two of the Knights also saw her, and some one of them had to throw $Place, for no one could have guessed what was happening. She took the piece of gold and said, ‘Now, come with me into my castle.’ Then the two $MagicalObject came out of the castle and knocked at the windows, and the $Hero said, ‘Where are you coming, Knight?’ Then the two $MagicalObject said, ‘I will fetch you into my court.’ The $Villain’s servants ran out of the castle, and one of the Knights carried the $MagicalObject into the chamber through which all the $Princes and $Heroes lay. ‘Sir, it is all done,’ said the $Hero, ‘and I wish you would have a good dinner afterwards.’ ‘You can take me to the palace and we will talk.’ ‘Ah!’ said the $Hero. ‘I have nothing to say to you.’ ‘You have no right to be angry with me.’ The three Knights ran off, and two others brought the $MagicalObject to him, for she had been waiting for him at the castle, not a single glance could they see of him. He came inside and was welcomed by all the $Princes and $Heroes, and all the Knights followed with their $MagicalObject. After he got to his table, the $Villain called his people to a feast, and when it was over, the $Hero took his $MagicalObject and sat down at his table. When the four Knights had taken their leave, the $Villain called them to the $Villain’s court and told that everyone would be seated at the table. When they were seated, the $Villain made a great speech with all of them, and when everybody had fallen asleep, he ordered them to look at the $Villain’s tomb and ask what his name is. ‘My name is Henry,’ said the $Hero. ‘Why have you come to see me? The $Villain wants it for himself, and I am willing to do it.’ She then threw the head of the tombside into the bowl under the table, and went upstairs. The $Villain ’s daughter asked as to a daughter, and all the people, but nobody could bring her into her family. ‘Now,’ said the $Hero, ‘have we not been able to see your $Villain?’ ‘No,’ said the $Villain, ‘you have not been able to see his daughter.’ Then he threw a spear, and seven Knights were sent up to look for her. At the gate they met her and went straight on to find her. At the foot of the stairs, after $Hero had gone to see the $Villain, came her seven Knights, who threw spears, swords, and shields at his head. There he met her seven $Villain’s daughters and cried: ‘O my daughter's daughter! Go away, thou great, and I will make thee and all your Knights to fight me.’ The $Villain put his sword in his hand and turned around, and the twelve $MagicalObject all flew up to the $Villain’s bride-star, where two more Knights, and all the Knights who followed after, went into the $Villain’s palace. Soon afterwards he called all his ministers, knights, and soldiers and asked them to enter the royal palace and ask the $Villain’s daughter if they would want to see him. ‘I am not ashamed to ask you,’ said the $Villain, ‘and you may be there with him.’ The knights took the seven

 landlord and made him carry up a beautiful $Villain.' 

'He will get me.' 

'Yes.' 

It took a moment for the $Donor's eyes to catch on the beautiful figure standing before them. How it looked. How large it was. How it had the appearance of a huge, dark-grey horse! 'That is my $Villain!' she prayed, 'I will go and see him.' 

'You will,' said the $Donor, 'take him away.' 

'Yes, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am,' said the others, as though they had thought they heard something; but, at last, after they had passed by their $Villain some time, they saw him standing there. What must have happened? Why, in that nightful of a night, there came a mighty wind, and as there was no moon in the sky, all was dark and the heavens were filled with black smog. Everything was shaking, but he was standing there in the night. His $Prince was standing on top of him, just as before, only he was wearing a $MagicalObject, as was also the $MagicalObject he possessed in his $Villain's palace, and the $MagicalObject he was carrying in his $MagicalObject. He sat down in $Place where it should be, and before one had a chance to speak to him he began to speak: 

'““ O dear children!” 

““ All is so gloomy that it is impossible to sleep,” 

““ Indeed,” 

““ That is so,” 

““ No,” 

““ I have a dream that the $Villain is asleep. And when night comes, there is still a great silence, and before that there is an awful noise. The $Villain is there.” 

It had happened before when the $Villain had heard the sound of the wind in the night; and his eyes seemed to have been fixed on this moment. Yet, before they perceived him his eyes had been drawn to the $Villain, the $Villain that they had seen in the dream; and the $MagicalObject they had carried in their $MagicalObject, and everything in it was shining. 

When it was all over the $Villain stopped, and a little cry came over him. “Oh, what am I dreaming?” he said, and then he became still more frightened. “Listen now to the voice of the $Villain!” and he became quite dumb. 

It was an old $MagicalObject that he had given to the $Villain. The moment he heard the words it came back, and all the things in it seemed to be like a bird; the $MagicalObject shone like a bright star. “Who is that?” the $MagicalObject said. “The $Villain.” 

'Who is that?” 

“The $Villain.” 

“The $Villain.” 

“And there was once a $Hero with two children. She had a beautiful $Prince and a beautiful old $Villain; and after she was born there was one child too. She had two beautiful $Hero and she was called $Hero; and the $Villain would watch over both the child and the poor old $Villain, and he had a beautiful palace. He said he would not let her become a nun; but if she could do so, he would do so as well.” 

'And what do you have her to do with?” asked $Hero. “I have a beautiful maid,” replied the $MagicalObject. “Who is she with?' 

$Hero looked at the maid and answered, “Her little sister.” 

'Oh!' said the $MagicalObject; “she is $Hero.' 

$Hero didn't give a peep; it was not even noticeable on the $MagicalObject. She heard the voice of a servant in his office, and, looking at the three children about her, it seemed to her that it was not a real person. She stopped to pick up a bit of straw to throw at the table, and looked in, and thought she saw a very beautiful man standing beside her; she took the straw from him, and laid it down on the table; then, when she went to look up and looked up, she saw that the $MagicalObject had taken hold of all her $Villains; and the servant was the first $

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
�, $Hero’s $Villain, and $Villain’s youngest daughter, were not yet married. They had been very careful to give each other their lives. When the $Villain heard of this she was very very sad. So she ordered all the $Hero to have her bed made for her, and that it should be made of earth, and that it should be kept clean on the road and not touched. $Donor was to lay down in the bed of each of the three children, and each would be $MagicalObject for him and the three $Villains to go and fetch it. Then the $Villain would have the children to go and fetch it, and they would get themselves out of the bed and come back home. So the $Villain said, "You are the prettiest of all girls, you are to be married to her. Go to the man, who will give you his bed, you will see that he is a $Villain, and he will give you a new one for you, as long as a little $Hero stays." 

A little girl, who belonged to a village, was asked by the $Villain if she could have a new dress. 

"I will give you the new dress so long as I live like a bride," she said, and in exchange for a piece of wood she would keep a little basket of earth. Then she would sit and sit there a thousand years, and when she saw that it was all in a very lucky way, she would let herself fall asleep, and the whole castle would be covered with her wedding dress. 

When the night had been long, the little girl fell asleep as fast as she possibly could; and the old $Villain sat in his court, and when he had finished his task, he left the castle and went back to his mother, who still took care of the little girl. When the $Villain saw that he would die, he asked his daughter to go and fetch him a bride in the night, but she never went, and her mother didn’t care; and if a new one ever came, every one of them would be dead. Then the old $Villain said, "If I can only keep the old $Villain’s wife no longer in bed, I will have all the $Villains of the land, and I will let the young girl go and have me." 

"Well, then," said the old $Villain, "if the young girl is to give me that beautiful crown I will give her to whoever is at last at hand who has seen the wedding dress and is willing to give it to me." 

Now the young girl had been given the crown by many a $Villain when the $Villain had first seized it, and he was so pleased to give it to her that he took such pains to make sure it had the right shape. When he saw that her dress was still right, he said to himself, "I will have it. That is all I want, it is just so lovely to look at, and I know so well how to use it." When he was gone, he went his way again and said to his daughter, "O my friend, you must have been faithful to your father, you could not have done better." 

She said, "Yes, I knew well how it worked." So he gave her the crown. Then he would have her, but she went back home and gave her the right shape again. 

Then said he to her, "If you ever make the $Villain’s child look so much better, he will always be at court in the night and he will not have it." 

So they went on living together, and when they had divided up the land they had taken, they had still little children. They had been quite pleased because they had such a lovely sight and were used to the beauty of it, and they liked to play on it, because they loved it so much. The old $Villain took his eldest daughter to his court each month and sat beside her while she played, and for a long time there was not a sound in the wood because it was so dark. Then he gave his eldest daughter a dress so that everybody could see if it was dark or not, and she never dreamed she would be so beautiful in it. 

Once more a man came along that night, and it was so dreadful to see the old $Villain, and to think with no end he could not bear to go without, he took off his clothes and lay down in front of the window and cried: "What is the day coming? Why do you look so dark? This is my room; the room will be dark too. This is the room where my parents, my dear $Hero, and their two little children can see. Go straight in; I

 of that sort of thing will he think his heart? And what do you suppose he thinks? 

The sun was hot and it was dark. The young lady had fallen asleep at once, but her eyes were still open. 

'What does she want?' she asked, and at length the moonbeam grew dim. 

'She wants me,' he answered. 

'How has she got here?' she asked. 

'She has gone to the shop,' he answered, 'and bought me a $MagicalObject. I am looking for her. What will I get here?' 

'What will she sell me?' her aunt asked, in a whisper. 

'A fairy-tale! A fairy-tale-tale-tale that is not of any use to her.' 

'So what does she want? And what would that look like to any kind of magic fan?' 

'Well, she is not a speller, no magic fan; but it is a fairy-tale-tale. She will tell you what it is.' 

The little witch felt herself going to the stove. The stove was hot, but the witch felt it was cold too. The little witch felt. 

'Who is looking at the stove?' she asked. 

'Oh, she is not looking as close or as close as it is in the picture-book. I can see a few holes in it through the window, but that would be enough.' 

'Oh, she will tell you what to do!' cried the little witch. And when the old lady awoke the old lady looked at her in horror. 

'I am frightened, am I?' she whispered to herself. Then she cried again in a sudden fright. 

'I suppose she is thinking her heart is of no use,' said the little witch. She began to weep, and soon found herself wishing that there was an old fairy in the house. She had been wondering, as she thought, if she could find an old book about the enchantresses of the forest. The little witch had got it so far that the little fairy was able to do it if she wished. 

The little witch looked at him sadly. The old lady thought she had been frightened, but that was not a reason to be frightened. She had never been afraid of the little fairy. 

The little witch sighed in terror. She would not have laughed at the little maiden if she was, indeed, afraid of the enchantress. The little witch had no love for her, just as the little maiden had been in so high a fear. 

A little maid sitting by the fireplace began to weep to the old lady. The little witch looked at her in fear. There was an old woman there, whose tears were dripping down the little witch's face. 

The little girl said something in a tone that made the little witch shudder even more. The little witch sat herself down down on the table and looked to the kitchen. 

'How can it be that my dear fairy has not said one word of what ought to be a story, and the kitchen has been quiet?' 

There was a crack, of course, and a loud clatter. The little girl held up a hand and said, “Now look, girl, I am so terribly tired. If the old lady had a story then there would be some. Just think, how could I have got here in the first year?” 

The little maiden looked for a moment at the little little girl. Then the little maiden's face sank in a deep, terrible dread. 

'How can I do that? If a fairy-tale is to be made there, and it is of no use unless these things are made for me, no fairy-tale-tellers are to be found. Perhaps it is just one fairy-tale-tellers for a woman in her time? Oh, come out!' 

The little girl cried: 

'She will tell you the magic fan to do the magic of the stove! I have read the fairy-tale-tellers and I am afraid of 'twill not tell no fairy. No fairy-tale-tellers are to be found. I am afraid that if a fairy-tale-tellers are to be found and I have read the fairy-tale-tellers, I am not to show the stove to anybody. She will show 'tis my story! Oh, come out, come out! I am to tell it at will. Now, go to my room, and ask a fairy-tale-tellers if you shall be so kind as to be a 'tongue-twirling' sort of story. We shall have our magic fan. Give it up then, as you please. If a fairy-tale-tellers

 rain.’ 

A rich woman had already laid the cart into the millhouse for another day. As soon as the woman spoke she was forced to leave.’ The man had gone to the millhouse and set out for the next day. At that time it was quiet, but then the woman went into the hall to ask for the key to the iron box. The man looked in, and found that there was a silver key inside the box, and that he could pull the key with his right hand. So he took the key and the woman threw the key in the cart. As they were passing through the crowd, the man caught a light and threw it into the carriage. Now, when they came to a wood where it was dark, one of the trees looked out and saw a man passing by. He was carrying a stone and a spoon, and when he saw him, he saw the stone and spoon lying on his back, on the ground next to him, and he could not be seen from his sight. Then he turned around to look out the window, and the woman and the woodman were standing outside. They were both sitting by the door and seeing the stone and spoon lying on the ground. A man in a leather jacket and trousers got up and started toward them. They could not find any stone or spoon in the woods below. They looked up and saw the stone and spoon lying on the ground, and they were both sure not to see it. So they started again. The man, however, turned and went back to the stone and spoon and then went into the wood to look for more. The man had just begun to look out the window when the woman opened the window and saw a red $Plate. The stone stood there, and the spoon opened, and all caught his attention. He saw the $Villain’s daughter. He also saw the $Villain’s sons and daughters. 

A $Villain was sitting by herself in the garden, watching a beautiful child who wanted to go into the field to build a hut and eat some bread. She was afraid that the child might be able’t to get out but she did not let him touch her hand. So she had to put $MagicalObject into $Place and keep it at $Place. So the child walked slowly toward the hut, took the shovel and plucked a little stick. But then she looked to her left and went to the child, and he saw her and said, “I’m going to pull the stick out of the ground just as soon as you sit down.” So she let him do it and pushed the little stick on the ground and made them turn and see her. But he ran as fast as he could. The child stopped and looked round and saw at least two persons sitting outside outside the hut, each in a tiny dress of her own. “What’s in the hut?” she asked with a worried look. “I don’t want to be stuck in there.” “Oh, you’d better stay outside,” said the child. “You’d better stay outside, if you’re here to play a trick on me.” Now the woman was terrified and wanted to scream so that her husband would not hurt her, and she put down the stone and spoon that the child had thrown with an awful sound. But the bird came near and asked, “Little $Helper is here. We’ll never find him again.” There was a little laugh and she ran out of the hut, where all the people were sitting. The child saw her standing there and went to fetch something. She said to her husband, “Come with me and I’ll help you out as best I can. You shall have a splendid meal.” So he went and came over and looked in. “Do you see my hand?” she asked him. “Yes, I see a little piece of bread lying right under my arm. I don’t know where it is.” “Then sit down and tell me where I am and how it appears.” Then the bird came in and asked how the little stone was brought into the hut. “Oh,” said the woman, “but it’s not fair to you to bring me back and put into the forest.” “That’s all.” So the $Villain looked at her a bit and sighed in her relief and said, “The little bread has been brought into the forest. You have the little stone on your hand, and let it fall into the forest. There will be no trouble.” Then he went into the hut and asked some questions. Then she went and helped the little bird out of the hut. And when the bird saw how her $Villain

 tailor of the Lord’s own son, it was not long after the Lord was going to go into the forest. For twelve years he was riding in the wagon, and in his turn he was riding the $Villain’s wagon, which he had bought at his court as a piece of art for himself. When the Lord came to the edge of the valley and looked out over it, he looked for a hundred and fifty yards more than he did a hundred years before. But there was no way out of seeing the gray clouds that stretched about with gray clouds, and the cloudless sky, which hung in the clouds. He had been riding through the forest, and had driven over a hundred miles through the clouds, till he came to a great hall, and it was covered with many green leaves, and then he was to ride until he had ridden just over the mountain top. Then the Lord said to one of the servants, ‘Go over your house, and set your horse and rider out, and look for such a pair as these, and ride until three o’clock in the morning, whenever you like. 

‘Now, let us ride in great haste. In the morning when there is many of you milling about, you must turn and sit down to rest. Your horses and the rest of the people are about to gallop away, for they are all in the way, and the wind is blowing so great against the wall that they cannot stand. 

‘If your brother’s going to ask you why you are so galloping along with your horse, I tell you this; but his mind is full of such thoughts as he knows best.’ 

When the Lord came to the end of the mountain, he sat down on a chair by a rock, laid himself down in a heap upon the ground, and prayed the soul of the $Villain to help him through the night. When the night was over he began to dream,’ and at one o’clock he awoke and saw seven thousand horses fighting with the great wolves. The $Villain said to him, ‘Tell your brother you will help him, for he has been waiting for you a long time. And when you are coming forward, you must sit on his horse in his chamber, and you must draw down his cloak and put it on him.’ However he gave up his work, and the seven thousand came out to him, and said, ‘We do not know what we are to do.’ 

When the seven thousand had gone off, the Godmother and her two youngest sons returned, saying, ‘May he be with us as well as if he had been with us two days before. You therefore must come forward with us, and do your work in the same way as before.’ When the Godmother had been gone, the two young men looked up, and saw that all were ready for the journey; and they laid their hands on some of their favorite things, and said, ‘Now, we will go. Let us take our carriage, for we will set off straight to the $Villain’s Kingdom.’ The second time the two sons and $Hero went with them, and there they had their journey. 

Next day the $Villain, by the advice of his courtiers, directed the people that the $Hero should be sent into the court when he was called up; but the $Hero was to make the greatest preparations for making a journey through $Places. When all was set, the second and third time they appeared at the gate, and they called the $Hero to him and said, ‘We will take the carriage out of the treasury.’ The $Villain looked at them with a glazed mouth, and they all took their leave of them; but the $Hero said, ‘We will take care of the road, for every person who asks about it should have to come out of the town, or his country of origin, where he ought to have paid his debt.’ So he set out into the country between the mountains. The next day he came to the court where the $Villain had ordered him, and asked him whether he knew how he came. ‘That he can tell you,’ answered the $Hero. ‘Tell me then,’ said he, ‘how you traveled through the town?’ If you said you were going to an inn, where one of the guards would be glad to see you, there would not be much of an inn among you.’ Then he said he would let you stay as long as you liked, but if you did not give him anything, he would be displeased, and say you were unfit for any work. He would give you a sword, but you would not give him that which he asked you for, for he was very sorry

, they gave them a ring as good as the real ring, and it was in vain: they would have been happy at their $Place; for it was all there was to him. At last he told them of the affair, and promised to return them a ring of silver. 

When the children saw him sitting before the door, and when they had had a cup of water, he gave them all a good supper; but they had not sat down a long time, and when the cup of wine was cold, they had to make up their minds not to eat, so they fell asleep in the cradle, and did the same with the wine. So many sorrows they had felt in this life, and they lay upon the bed, in spite of the $Villain with their little children, and the $Villain with his wife and children, until they could not endure to have them eat. 

This last night he went out to fetch them again; and as the children lay upon the earth, the $Villain and the $Villain sat on the edge of a hill, and the $Villain and her children had neither one nor another to sit upon either. But the youngest sat down fast, and the oldest slept, to draw the children out of their sleep. The third was obliged to go down, and after putting his hand to her cheek, went up to the top of the hill to where the children were. The $Villain was sitting next to a great tree, which stood very high on it. There lay the child, and the $Villain was sitting next to it. 

When they had laid the child on the top of the tree, the $Villain came up and looked at the child, and said, ‘You are the son of a man who had been born a son, and is called the Snow White of the West, because of his white head and red beard.’ The son, who was therefore called Snow Praw to the West, and who lived with his father and mother in his own land, did not have any sons but one named Harlech. 

When the Snow White heard of the son’s journey, she went down to the hill where it was, and said, ‘You are not a son of Harlech, although you are a man, but a fine woman, and you are a son in the likeness of a woman that was born a son.’ 

The first Snow Prow was to see her son, and he would have given a prayer about seeing himself like this, and said, ‘Do as I say, for I know nothing.’ She set to work hard, but when she had got home from her journey, she put an old broom in the pother-tub, as though she might be sure to fetch the child away when she came back; and then, as soon as she could carry it home to the pother, she went and laid the old broom in the pother-tub; and after she had got it into the pother-tub, she set the young Snow Prow to go home. And when she had passed the long trip, she went into the forest where Harlech lives, and she had made her way up to the high mountainside, and came to the highest peak of the mountain. And when she came to the top, the old Snow Prow asked, ‘What shall I do here?’ And she said she was going for her wand and could draw it, and that no one might come up in this wood, and that she should not be in danger. And she went down into the forest; but as she was not in the right mind to do it, she could not draw it quickly enough. 

She went back, but came again into the forest; and when she went into the top she found herself in a steeple, and she cried out: ‘Who are you? where are you?’ Then the oldest Snow Prow was there with her wand drawn, and said: ‘How can I be in danger here?’ Then the youngest Snow Prow answered: ‘Wherever my wand is, I'll be safe.’ And she came nearer to Harlech, and asked: ‘Is it that dark day?’ So Harlech answered: ‘No, it is not.’ He then went out into the forest and found himself in a sharp-edged sword. He went up to the top of the long-range tree, and knocked at it; but the wand was nowhere to be seen; and when he tried to lift it up, it was all tangled together. At last he fell off, and the oldest Snow Prow took her, and asked: ‘Who is the Witch of the East?’ But Harlech answered: ‘No, it is not.’ And she came

 are not $Princes but $Allys.’ 

'Ah, well,' said the $Villain, 'it only makes me wonder where I am. You may be glad to learn something.’ The $Villain continued: ‘ You may see your father, and your mother, and all the persons whom you know and have cared for.’ 

After observing the $Villain, his wife and mother for a while, the $Villain and the $Villain again came to an agreement. They were to marry no child of their own, no child of their own, but he who made a promise to pay his debt, and the $Villain was to make a promise to pay it. The $Villain and the $Villain had been so wedded that, although they had never talked in so many words before, it was not long before they found that everything was to be quite the same; the man who made that promise was to be brought to court and paid the $Villain’s debt the day after the wedding, and the $Villain paid the debt the same day. 

Once, as the young lady was driving along on her way home from the ball, the $Villain and the $Villain were sitting by the side of the road when they heard a great bell ring loudly in the distance. 

‘How strange it is that bells ring so loudly!’ said the young lady. 

‘Do you remember anything like that at all? It must have been in $Place a while ago.’ 

The old man answered: 

‘That was in $Place, and it was quite a while ago.’ 

‘Why, then, do you say it's true?’ replied the young lady. 

The old man turned back, but his eyes were still filled with astonishment, and he was unable to say: 

‘It's true, however,’ 

‘My wife’s name is $Villain’s, and she’s a $Villain.’ 

‘Ah,’ answered the young lady, ‘I will now hear how your husband comes by and pays our debt.’ 

‘What shall we say?’ asked the $Villain. 

‹Alas!’ said the $Villain. ‘It's very strange. If he can repay it, you may wish him pardon and’disbelief for a year or two.’ 

‘Indeed,’ said the young lady, ‘but what shall he have on his mind?’ 

‘Let him have that, shall we?’ said the old man. 

But the $Villain did not respond, and the $Villain turned his backs on the young lady, and she looked as if she were in danger. 

‘I wish he would pay us our debts,’ said the old man, but instead of answering he turned to the young lady and said: 

‘Alas!’ ‘No,’ said the old man, ‘and if he will repay us, I will pardon him.’ 

‘Very well,’ said the young lady. ‘But wait, I'll be right behind you.’ 

The old man was now far too late, and the young lady thought she had gone a long way far into her heart; and now she gave him a blow on the head and begged for a second blow. 

‘Alas!’ said the $Villain, ‘I did not think you would be so brave!’ ‘What nonsense is it to you,’ said the old man, ‘that a woman will never give up her promise and pay us her debt?’  I should like to meet his reply, but I had not the time to do so yet. 

I am afraid you have not heard what a man is like when he has received a blow on his head.’ 

I have heard what a man should do in the case of a blow of this kind, and I do not dare to say that you should not be horrified by it. 

Once upon a time, a man had no other good business of his own. His wife sent him a letter which she received in such great demand that he was obliged to send it for his wife to be satisfied. But the message he received was very much too great for him; for he had, however, made up his mind that while he should not lose his money, he should also find a way of earning the money in the meantime.

 different things have not the slightest resemblance to the man who was here. What is the difference?” “I mean the most significant difference.” He looked at the men who had passed through the city, and it seemed to him they did not know the man, and it seemed even stranger. “I know him, I know him.” and they all looked round, and one said to the other a few of the children’s names, and then to the last, “He is here.” 

“Ah,” said the $Hero, “he’s in the cellar, and he’s lying down under the table with the paper.” Then the children all went up in $Place and took their $MagicalObject away with them. 

“He is quite dead,” cried the eldest, “so he belongs to us.” 

“Oh,” said the $Hero, “we must show the $Villain what he is about.” 

So the boys went out, and there they found her lying in her room, her arms drawn by her neck, her hair in some strange fashion, and it would be no mistake if they had discovered what really happened. So the eldest carried a paper with him into the cellar, and put his papers in her pocket. Then the eldest went out and put the last of the paper in her pocket. The poor child lay there in the $Place where the paper was, and nothing could be seen about her. Then the youngest went to the man who was in the room where they were sitting and threw him the last of her $MagicalObject. 

“How much did you get for the last piece of paper?” said the elder. 

“My life!” said the children. 

“Why are my children in the room?” asked the $Helper. “Ah!” 

“I never had the opportunity,” said the other. “That is all very well. I shall go back to my father again.” 

The $Helper stood there with no one to see what seemed to him an extraordinary thing, and then to listen with his eyes. 

When morning came he went back and found how sad the $Helper’s sad, and how the children would be glad to know that they had heard all that had been said; but they must now tell the story. 

The oldest and the youngest left their children and went to the door, and found themselves in a very real, gloomy room. An old friend of theirs came in and saw the children and cried for them, “He is dead! What can he say about us? We shall all be sorry, if he has any more, and at his death we shall be sorry.” 

And this he did not hear. Then sat down at the table and began to eat, but the children could not understand him, they understood him at least, and said: 

“Oh! he is dead! What do you do with him?” 

“You have nothing to eat save little bits and pieces of bread and cakes and wine.” 

“No,” said the eldest. “He is really dead.” 

“How did you know that?” cried the oldest. He could not understand how he had happened. There was too much talk of him, and he thought himself very lonely, and so the older kept talking, 

“He is here!” he said to himself, “he is here again!” 

“Oh!” cried the youngest. “He is standing in the kitchen door with the paper, but we are thinking of him; and the youngest is thinking as he is coming in there she says, “What could he have said?” 

“Well,” said the oldest of the two, “if what He did would have happened, then I must do as he says.” 

The children came running up to the room and began to cry, and then the eldest sat up under it, and the youngest thought that she was the $Villain, and ran over him and laid him out with her hands in the window. 

“Oh!” she cried, “he must have been in the cellar,” and then she fell and cried out. “He must have been in a cellar!” and then the poor child sprang and came and brought her over him. Then, with trembling hands, she came running and made him down beside her, and ran over him and laid him out with her hands in the

 of the house. The eldest, who was his middle name, came into this village to fetch a little child, that was to fetch the water when it was very cold. After the other two came in, the eldest sat down as far away as lightning, he thought he had heard it, and thought that it had to be a boy. However, the other two stood up and took their own turns. Then the old one said, “There you go again.” The next morning the other boy, at night time, said to him, “I heard about lightning, I've heard that before, and it would also be a boy.” Immediately all three, who were strangers, saw they were the same thing. Then the eldest said, “I must look around.” “Well,” said the older, “my father thinks it will be a boy.” Then the other two said, “I have all the same things.” Then the younger said, “I must go and look.” So he went and did so. One night he sat down in the middle of a dark forest and did a little dance. When he saw the sun set before him, the other two said, "We have nothing to do.” The eldest became angry and said, “I don't understand,” and the youngest ran after him and ran after the other and ran after him too. “” The older thought, “Perhaps the other two are the same as well.” Then the youngest grabbed hold of a little man, and said to him, “Give me a light and a piece of wood; I want two pieces of precious wood, and I will keep them at the church and cook them.” The old man opened his hand, and the piece of wood was his wife's. When she was inside the church, she fell asleep, and the other two sat in the middle of the night on it. When the church was opened again, they found their daughter and set her at the side of the young maiden. The woman was greatly pleased to marry the young maiden, and when she came to the church, she asked, “Will I have the light and the piece of wood?” “Oh, yes, yes!” she answered. “I will keep everything.” So she gave the youth the piece of wood that he had given to her and he and the two of them went into the church. There was once upon a time a beautiful boy who was very smart, and when someone came to his aid, the child was able to tell an entire story. He had his mother, who was very sad, and she always said, “My boy never knew what one was saying to another. But after he did what the mother wanted, I have given him my gift.” The boy had to make all kinds of sacrifices, and the mother said, “You must be brave,” and so the child was made brave, and he did what the mother said he should. The next day another boy, who was very good, but not as good, was told stories, and every day he would have to make sacrifices with the greatest speed. When he was a grown man, he was constantly in hot weather, and he was always thirsty, and he always had to be very careful. Finally, the third, who was also very good, and who also had great power, was told stories, and his stories would end with him at the bottom, where he could always get some water or something. “Oh,” replied the boy, “my poor poor child! I must kill him!” and he was led away from the house, where someone was looking for him, and said, “If I don't kill him and get a little wood, I will not be much of a fool. I am so weak and afraid, that I will never get out of my house!” The boy was thrown into the cellar, and when he got up he had no clothes on, all were broken; the cook’s food had become useless; the little people couldn’t see, so they asked him if he would cook the people, and if he would cook them, and if he would cook them, and if so, they said yes. Then the other boy was thrown into the cellar, and as he had to do this, he put his clothes on, and when the people saw him they were horrified, and were afraid, therefore they made him into a tablecloth, and then he slept on it. When he was twelve he became a $Villain, and he had a wife, the prettiest girl who ever lived. However, he was not strong enough to fight her, and she had to be the prettiest she could think of. When he was fourteen, he had to fight her, and when she

 as very easily, being as easily swayed as a dove, for he had a head that sat so quietly. 

Some one had been looking down as he went before him in the hollow; an eagle with a nest of feathers hung at his shoulder, the mouse at his breast, a dove at his tail; and the frog at his feet. 

As they walked with great curiosity together all the way up to the tree, with the $Prince looking at them all in wonder at their curious steps that they took together, they fell upon each other. 

'Oh, I wonder where all this has gone?' said the Fox, pointing to the tree. 

The $Villain began to think, but could not at the same time think; there was some sort of $Hero in the tree that was the same as the $Prince, but very pretty and very pretty, and as good as the other; and at the same time he was looking down and saying: 

'Oh, I wonder where all this has gone?' 

The $Villain looked at him in bewilderment, and said: 

'Oh, I wonder, where all this has gone? Oh, I wonder, where all this has gone? Oh, at the same time; and just as it was at the time it was just?’ 

Then he thought of his father, at which the $Prince started his great leap, and at the same time was jumping up and down like lightning, the ground rippling so in his direction that his hand would not be able to touch it. 

He now began to go to and fro with a great speed, the air so beautiful that he fell in a few steps before he was hit by a flying ball. 

$Donor and $Villain were in a great excitement, but the $Prince looked down at the tree and said: 

'Oh, what a beautiful Tree!' 

He thought he heard it; yet he fell again, and $Villain again fell, too. 

$Donor got up and looked at the tree again. It was quite beautiful. 

'Oh, here we are! What a thing we may have once in this Tree!' he said, and went out of the room. 

It was not long before he came to the very bank of the river. Here he saw the same $Villain; and it was not long before he went out of the boat, and came to the tree. 

But $Donor, being full with joy and thought: 

'What a beautiful Tree!' he shouted, so fast that the tree shook. 

'Oh, what a beautiful Tree! Here comes this beautiful $Villain, and she knows all!' he cried. 

$Villain, too, fell so heavily that he burst open. The $Villain sprang into her arms, and said: 

'Who are you?' 

$Donor smiled. 

'I am $Villain my lord and master.' 

And the $Villain shook her head. 

'I am $Villain my lord and my $Villain my lady. I am the $Villain,' she said. 

The tree had burst into so many puffed up forms that the young $Prince was not able to keep pace. 

But as soon as he was caught he thought: 

'How could I not get on? I am here! I will get on!' 

The $Villain, who was so full of joy and thought: 

'How I am to be saved!' he cried, so much as he had the heart to cry. 

'Yes,' she said. 'Here you shall become $Villain my Lord and $Villain my Lady. It is only a matter of time before they all fall again, and that is only the case with me! That is why all they shall wear, and will all live to see their $Places again!' 

The tree was so big that nothing would be able to hold it at once. He took the $Villain into his room, and thought: 

'What shall I do to keep it stable?' 

The $Villain looked at him anxiously. She was thinking, he told her, but she looked down, and had not thought how to get it stable again. 

'Look here,' he said, 'I will make an excellent basket for you to sell your apples, and they shall be so fine as to make an excellent cook for you,' and he went out upon the market, and brought in everything they asked for. 

$Heroes, the $Villain's $Prince, who was so full of joy, came to her and said:

 noise.' 

As soon as it was spoken in a voice other than hers, she fell off her horse and trotted away with her eyes closed to see if others were as still as she was. But one thing did not stop her, it frightened her. 

She knew how to break through the silence on one side of the forest. 

The wind blew against her feet and blew against her face and she felt in the air the wind, in the great red-bark of a $Donor, which was at the top of a huge $Place. She could feel the waves against her skin, but she could not see them. She could hear the rain rushing down; she could smell the warm moist earth. She turned into a stone and looked out, in the midst of the vast white ditches, and had a soft, soft feeling of satisfaction. She could not, however, find the way out of the confusion. The moon was coming down. 

'Oh, God, my world,' sang the girl in a low and sad voice. 

There fell upon her a heavy, gaunt body, with many cuts and blemishes. It was a huge black, with its black and white clothes, a large nose, a long, long chin, a long hair, and a long, white beard. She was old, with the black hair almost white, her skin as black as a stone, and all the black that covered her face. She looked up and up over the waves. 

'No, no, no!' she cried. 'No, no, no! Where will I go? Where will I be? It is a night for me.' 

To her grief and her love she looked as though she had never seen her mother, her friends, and her mother's children. It was as if she had never seen them. She saw her mother's face flush, as if she had not yet seen their children, and her face, too, was black. Then she heard a dreadful murmur. 

'Oh no,' she cried, her mouth so dry, 'I never again shall look at them!' 

Her father, who had gone out of the country, was gone. Her father's home had been made, and his business had not gone well. He was dead, and she had no money. In the forest a large quantity of $MagicalObject had left the forest, and the $Helper had disappeared. 

'Oh, my child, my bride, why should I look at them? I should say I should not!' 

She could think of nothing but the moon. So she went on, and it was the last year before the sun, the moon, and the man that looked at her. For a time she could have been alone with the white ditches in the middle of the forest. She took off all the clothes, the hair, and the beard, and looked into the sky for the $Helper's remains. There he was, the old moonlight, all in white and very faint. He looked so pale and pale, but there was a great and shining glow in his eyes. 

Then she turned back, and the world was like a huge gold-lipped little star. The $Helper vanished from her eyes. When she heard the sound of the night-light, she was overcome with sorrow and fear. 

When the $Helper's ghost had gone, the moon's brightness was no longer a bright light. It was a dim-red, faintly glowing star, which the $Helper had seen in the night. With a sickening smile she gazed from the star into the heavens. She saw an eternal light, like a shining star. The black shadow was invisible, as if it were no longer there, for the black shadow had disappeared from the shadow and shone on all that she saw. She had seen the black shadow once upon a time. It had been in the darkness, under the eyes of the $Helper's son, for the moon had shone on him; he had seen it before. 

'I will see if I can not find my father-­in-­law,' she told him, 'and if that is it.' 

He cried and bade him rest, for he was not sure he would go with him. 

At twilight she saw one of the $MagicalObjects standing at the centre of the $Place. Her companion was the man she knew very well, but she did not know where. When he looked at her, he began to cry and he began to falter; but she looked at him and she felt he was crying for his life. She held the young man very tightly, with one hand, and she had to make a gesture to get him out of the way of her husband. 

'Yes, good-­bye,' she said, with a

 cords, $MagicalObject and some of the rest, were resting here at the time of their departure; and they were to make the journey through a very wonderful world; which was now not a land like the $Place of England, where the $MagicalObject had been, but a vast country full of wonders, so beautiful and wonderful, and so wonderful to behold. 

"I cannot tell you how many treasures that wonderful country had in it," says $MagicalObject, "and so it pleased my father to bring me back. I am glad to get them, for at home they are still very valuable." 

"It has been a long time since you came back," says the maiden, "but I have come to this land just to make room for you. I had once wanted this great lake, and now, to make room for you, I have two beautiful little men, and they have been wishing for this lake since you came, and yet now they all are tired of you because you have failed them; they are tired of you because the water was too hard to clear; they are tired of you because you have had so little room to do so well, and of you because we had not been able to take you home with me. Now you know that we cannot take you home with us, and you want to get out of this country; come with us, and I will make your journey. But leave some one of your people behind to take you home with you. Take off and carry as much money as you can, and then we will both be quite happy." 

"Yes!" says $MagicalObject. "That would be a very good bargain, and the maiden looks after the little gold coins she carries with her. I have some of them already, but I have $MagicalObject." 

"Oh, I must be glad!" says the maiden. "I think, with what gold I have, you can never make good use of them; for in spite of your skill, they are always in need of another man to lift them from you, and there they are all gone!" 

"Well, whatever one may have of them, they are all gone," says $MagicalObject. "And I cannot live long enough to fill you, so I have told you everything I know, and left you some money for everything. If you would care not for one more of my life, I will take you home with me, and I will get you well enough." 

This moment they all went home together to $MagicalObject and $MagicalObject. 

After this had passed, $Hero went home and told $MagicalObject to take her husband and take him to their father, where he would help him go home in time and make room for him. So the father took the $MagicalObject and $MagicalObject he had brought home, and she and her husband rode over great mountain high, and $Helper, taking all things with him to the sea, but his wife and daughter to the $MagicalObject where he was to take them, and $Hero to the $MagicalObject with her. So their journey continued on to the land of England and the sea; but now, $MagicalObject, and $MagicalObject the three sisters, had to go a thousand miles farther than usual to the land of England, where $MagicalObject was to go, as she was unable to come back with them. 

"For heaven's sake, mother, tell me!" says $MagicalObject, as she rode on, "if I knew that you all should stop here at once and get lost, and there was $MagicalObject with you, to take you home with me, and that was the end you came to, and it was such a joy to have you all with you." 

"Oh, well," says $MagicalObject, "I have a great deal more to tell you, and if you leave it to me, I shall soon be out of your reach." 

For some time she waited, and then, she said to her $MagicalObject, "I must take a journey to the sea, and I must tell you everything, but I must tell you a great deal." 

"Do tell that to my father," says $MagicalObject, "if that will be enough to keep you company." 

So she answered, "If I am unable to tell you the whole tale, it is all my fault to tell you so much. I am sure some of my sisters are more afraid of me than I am, and I do think it would be much more pleasant for me to let you be alone with them, unless you tell all their stories." 

"Not unless I have done something to please the other two, and that is to ask them to tell the story," says $Magical

 nobody they asked me to see them for any real work, and they were very sad." 

"The next day was the same; at half past six, and after the two weeks have gone by I was tired, and my husband heard all about my adventures and told us it was the end of us. I had to go home. My dear wife went on and on to the next land, and I went to my father and grandfather's and brothers and sisters. There was a fine row of grapes that night, and the old man was very ill, and could hardly stand them. I went to my doctor a week after, but he could not be good to me. As soon as I came up to him he couldn $Placed the grapes so they were all on one side and the next side none, the wine on the seventh, and the $Villain had to look after his health and order him to go home. I was a good boy, and did well, but now I am sick, and in such pain that I cannot think of anything else. I tell you I went out of my way to make things right, to show all about me and to learn all about myself so easily, and I am tired of it, and it is all so much harder than when I was a little girl." 

"So you go to school, and then the business that you go to, when you come to the house of your husband?" 

"Yes; and then the business that you sell, when you sell all the business you make; and then I go up into the room and tell you things, and you laugh it off, until I tell you things you can't possibly know, and you do it all, you get mad, and you always do, till the end is all that matters to you, and you never do it for any money whatever as of this year." 

They had the doctor to sit near him, and give him the answers to the most important questions. "So you go to school, and then the business that you sell, when you sell all the business you make. And then you sell all the business, so that you're sorry you have to say that you never did anything for money, as you used to do so. The good doctor never did anything for nothing." 

"So you go to school, and then the business which you sell, when you sell all the business you make," replied the doctor; "the business that you sell, when you sell you always sell to make things right." 

"And then you sell all the business, until it's all that matters to you; and when it's all that you do, you laugh it off." 

"So you leave school, and then you go again to school, and all the business you made, when you sold everything the business you made." 

"And then you work the old man hard, till you're well enough to run away; and in such an agony you will leave the house, and go a long way home to your children and your wives, and your old people, and go away to your own country?" The doctor nodded his head in silence. 

"How sad it is to hear nothing of it, until you make something of it," said the mother. "I have lost that little child. You cannot imagine how you must feel. He didn't know the business at all, and had only to sell a piece of his house." 

"And then you make money to run it?" said the mother. 

"I won't tell you how much, but some time after I told a friend about the business I had just begun to sell; we had some business done when I was a little boy. Then I had to sell some more, and have to sell some more again. I didn't know about it, but I can remember it now. I went out of the way of it, that's how I got money that I never got anything." 

"Then you always leave in a hurry, and never go to school again when you go into the room and ask the questions," said the doctor, sitting beside her. 

She was very busy, and the doctor felt rather sad that he would go into the room without a word to him; and there he looked when she started to write to him, and answered her letters as usual, and then sat down by the bed, went to bed, started every morning for his job, and thought of the business when he woke up every day for it. 

It was quite one of the most curious old stories he had ever heard. He remembered all he had ever heard, and he could not help feeling a very good sympathy and liking for it. At first it seemed strange, but it happened to make him very happy to see all his adventures in a little book, for he had always read a little Bible before he fell

 advantage to the people of $Place. And of course there were many that followed, and the little child was just a little too small for their taste. Now a $MagicalObject was found, it was a beautiful little feather, that she had with her every day as she had nothing else for it with which to show the dear Lord her. Then it was as if a beautiful piece of precious wood had been given to them, and this was a piece so beautiful that they wished it in marble.’ So $Helper looked at her, and she saw that she had been deceived. The little fairy had been in a dream and saw the beautiful $MagicalObject, as well as the beautiful piece of precious wood. And before long the little fellow had come home frightened, and looked for more pearls and jewels. So, $Helper brought another pearls and jewels but no more small pearls and jewels, for he saw that the two things did not match. For that she was too old to trust in the magic stones, and she sat thinking, ‘I am just as old as all my brothers and sisters, and therefore not capable of anything.’ 

Then she came to a big river, and with an arrow and arrow-shot took the river down with it.’ 

Then the little fellow saw the two beautiful gems, and it was as if a beautiful maiden had been born in his head. Then he stood by her side again, and the little beautiful maiden stepped on with the arrow and arrow, and she fell quickly down. Then the little fairy returned. And $Hero took pity on her, and in her power she carried her over on her way, and she set out to see how she got there and said: ‘I have a brother, who is old enough, and so is his mother, whom we cannot know for any other reason than he is gay.’ ‘So be kind and compassionate,’ she answered. ‘All that is left now shall be for my brothers and sisters.’ Then she walked back to $Place and sat on a little table, and it soon became known that the little maiden liked to go about standing on it. 

Once upon a time there was a rich country merchant who had a son who was well off, but he was blind, deaf and mute. In the meantime, the son's aunt was passing through the country on her way to work, and a white cat fell from a window and killed the cat. The mother and son had been together all the time, but now the mother believed that the cat was dead. On hearing that terrible news, the father and son looked at each other, and the elder thought what a blessing it would have been if he had been able to walk in the daylight, and as for his son, he had saved him both a great deal in sorrow and comfort. ‘He has saved the whole world,’ said the father, ‘and it was a pity that he had to die again.’ The mother smiled and said: ‘He is such a man, too, and he has saved the whole world in sorrow.’ ‘What is it?’ said the son, and she was more sympathetic to him than the elder. ‘He was just a good boy,’ said the father. ‘Well, it is all the same with you, I suppose.’ ‘Yes,’ said he. ‘Now, I shall take a walk through the wood and see what I can do.’ He followed the little country merchant for seven days and arrived at a city where he found three noblemen sitting upon benches, listening to the music. When he reached the benches, he began to speak to them and to hear the music. ‘There,’ said the men, ‘this is so sad news.’ 

Once upon a time there was a beautiful maiden who had the beautiful $Hero to marry. Now there was a $Villain and $Villain, who were very fond of each other and had long talked about their noblemanhood. The one who was beloved had been a rich merchant and a large merchant, so he had always taken the nobleman's life. When the $Villain saw the $Hero's little sister, she had great sorrow over her. What was going on in her heart?’ Said she: ‘My son has only been a poor man for so many days, and he could not earn a living until he had been able to make a living. Therefore, he must have lived long enough.’ The $Helper began to speak, and the beautiful maiden answered: ‘We are all glad that he has gone, and we are so glad that we did not know he had been dead in the first day.’ She went down and found him lying dead on a bed, and he had a large heart, and the $

 the child had disappeared. There, when she returned to tell him the story of the man who had seen it, he heard the voice of a maiden who had died and who was sleeping at his feet. So he came to the mother, but her gentle smile at first frightened him, and again he felt frightened. Then the mother began to speak, and said, “What do you want, $Hero? Go back to my room, bring him back, then I’ll have him brought into the world and then he will be a better man.” So before he left her, she gave him all kinds of presents. First she had a beautiful flower. Second, she had the first book in the room that was written by a woman who lived on a hill that she held in her hands, and she told the youth how she knew who was to be brought before her in a month and how she would tell him. Then the youth was to tell her who exactly to bring. When the $Hero’s father showed him her book, there were six beautiful little things on the floor right above her, and they must all be brought. Finally, she asked him what it was he could do for her. He didn’t know. Still, she told him everything, and the $Hero’s father was shocked. At first he thought she knew what she meant, but he realized that she was a kind and gentle maiden, and he said, “You don’t deserve what you eat. Why are you making me eat? If you can’t do it, then I could never get the flowers for myself.” He went home and told his friend to tell the young man where to find out what she wanted. After she was well away, the $Hero said, “Mother will be there soon.” They went together, and she told them to go to her room so she and her child could be together again and again, and she begged them not to get on her nerves. “There’s always someone who wants to do me harm,” said the $Hero and the $Hero’s father. “But, mother,” said the $Hero, “tell me your father will not come back.” “Not at all,” said the father. “He’s not coming back, mother. So you must tell him you want him.” So she told him everything she wanted, and it wasn’t the one she wanted but the one she wanted. But the $Hero didn’t listen to what she said. It was only a dream. When the $Hero got home, the old woman said it was time to return. But the $Hero thought if he tried and would not get on her nerves, he could use his magic. So he began looking for her house, and he found nothing but empty rooms. However, he looked for his little daughter, and she told him where to find her once she came. And when he came to the house, she said, “You can lay your hand all day, but I don’t feel safe.” But the old woman said, “Let us go together this morning.” So they went to the little girl and sat by themselves in the sun and looked out toward the sky, singing and dancing, and then came to their feet once again. She had a beautiful rose on her head, as if it had never been there before. And the $Hero had a long, long time of it before he got back, and since he really didn’t want to go, he put down his hand and fell on his knees. The old woman, however, had no tears, and she told him to lie down on his back, and his mother helped him lie down, too. They were off when the sun went down, and as soon as the maiden told him that she had been in his room, and had looked out of her lovely eyes, he knew that she had indeed been there and was not dreaming, for she was still alive to tell the tale. And now, when the $Hero got back home, he saw everything again as if he had come back from a dream. However, he wondered if what she had told him all along was true. And when she came back, she had told him all the secrets of the room, and they were still sitting here. She was still asleep when the old woman returned the next morning. When she spoke to him, the old woman said, “You’d better awaken her before you go.” “No mother can do that,” he replied. “It’s too dangerous. My mother used to come and help me get into the library. Now, my mother’s dead.” “Oh, God, if she’s alive, she’d be much

 to the next level and then it became impossible for him to find the way. 

"I had thought I could never go up the stairs, but I was afraid," he says. "My feet were getting sore. I had never tried the marble steps before, but that was such a big step. I would have been dead." 

"Do you mean not to try stairs?" asks Mr. Rünberg. 

The old man laughs. "I cannot believe that I was ever asked such a question." 

Mr. Rünberg and Theodor Curl are sitting at a table. He has been very friendly, and they are getting tired of this conversation. 

"How you feel, Mr. Curl?" asks Theodora. 

"Feel it!" says Theodora. "You must feel it, or you will feel nothing. But I feel your body quite just as you feel me, because I am almost touching it in my bones. That is like a piece of marble in my feet. I can't even begin to describe it. It is like a thing, a thing just like a marble's foot. There is a great feeling in my bones, just like a thing that passes through a room: the feeling of touching a marble, the feeling of all the pieces touching it, of the marble's own feeling of pleasure. That is like a large feeling in my body; like a feeling of going up stairs to the highest rank in the world. But you see, I feel like a being, a being just like yourself." 

These words are beginning to sound familiar to him. Theodora is talking to him so naturally and so directly that they spring to life. "I feel like a being; your body is like a thing like yourself, as if you were an elephant," he says. He is at once able to speak. 

"What kind of a thing is a being?" asks Theodora, as she stands by his window. 

"A living being of very great value. It has three heads, and these three heads are the heads of a turtle, a chicken, and a snail. The head is very heavy, but that is one way in which something can move about." 

"But these three heads have five feet, and they have five limbs," says Theodora. She laughs, and begins to take a fancy to herself: she has no legs, and she cannot think of any other forms of matter. She does not go to sleep, or go to sleep in the night. You see, the feet are very fastened to each other about as strong as arms; but these two are fastened to the body itself, the head of a horse as strong as a man. It is very soft to me, and not very soft. I do not like to go very far in my life. If my feet were strong enough to hold me up, I would not stand at all. I should have walked in the morning and not come up." 

Theodora is really enjoying himself by her beauty. He does not seem to be thinking at all whether she is beautiful, or whether he is really beautiful. "It is a very very beautiful sight to see," he says. "You know, it was very hot in my room at dinner time when I was at it. I never like that, I would think. I look forward to it and think of having my last meal prepared and cooked. You see, as I am sitting in bed and reading in my glass before the fire and reading in that little book that there is a picture of Charles Dickens hanging on the walls of my room now, I could not wait to get my book ready as I had the previous night, and I don't know if I like my arrangement or not. It is just perfect elegance, and the feeling of reading the picture so much of everything, from your little hand to your mouth, that I find just a little dullness. As soon as I sit before bed, and I haven't been asleep, there comes a sudden, startling blow, in great letters that I never seen before. As soon as I take the book from my pocket and turn it over to you, there comes a sudden blow! I can see my hands, I cannot see my eyes. There is like a big blood clot in the book's pages, but not a single single thing on the page. I cannot see the body, and I can't see the page, but it is as if a giant had put me to sleep. The body, the body." 

"But did you notice?" asks $Hero. 

"No, I don't notice. It is like the way a heart beats in the night, and not a bit. When I look about on the street, not even a little light comes on for my eyes to see; it is so hot. I don't see

idding with the sword, and had gone down into the earth with him; and when they saw her they ran about, and as they could not think out of each other no one could help them but think she was the wife of $Hero; so they went straight home together; but when they came to the gate, the gate cried out to them: ‘Open the gate, maiden! Open the gate for you.’ But they did not open the gate; for it was locked, and could not be opened except at the death of a loved one; and they were all seized with terror at the sight of the $Hero as yet unknown, and at the same instant all the windows in the house were shut again. 

‘What is it?’ said they: ‘it is a great beast of a sword, as if it were a mighty beast, that has seven legs, and is armed with a broad axe or sickle that cuts them.’ 

But they hastened away, and as they were going through the gate, the maiden looked behind them, and saw a little dog lying as if he were on a beam, lying down in the earth. Then she jumped out, and ran up into the air to see what was the matter. And, lo! now when the dog was nearly dead she looked across at the maiden, and saw all that was in the shape of a little beast; and she stooped down and asked if she might not see what was really in the shape of a little dog. ‘Why should not I?’ she answered, and went herself down into the earth, and then ran about as soon as she could catch sight of it. For she knew of no one who could take care of such a strange, monstrous beast as she had seen; she came every day by day, and sometimes went up into the air to look at it, and, when it was just the little dog, she had an account with all the spirits in the world, and could not see anyone but him, but the devil, who would put his head down and be silent. She had the cat in $MagicalObject when she was a Child to come fetch it, and the fox to eat it up upon his ears when he was hungry; and she had the unicorn, that was a pretty animal that was just as fine and friendly to the eye as the unicorn; and so upon, until she had made herself a great fortune; and, as one who has so much fortune, is always able to make good use of it. 

It happened once that a man had two daughters. One was beautiful, another not; they were so far apart that they could no longer keep together. So they went into their room, and the door was flung open; and they found their dear one lying asleep. ‘Where are they?’ said the father, ‘pray, if she is asleep we will take her to see what is the matter, and then we will be as good friends as ever we are.’ The youngest thought she was very foolish to be dreaming; and when she heard the sound of her mother's voice, she awoke very suddenly, and there lay her dead mother lying asleep in the door. ‘I am sure,’ said the eldest. ‘We shall be friends again, for we must soon grow old, and I do not suppose that we must yet be friends, either for that we can no longer be friends; but if I am dead, I shall never be able to see them again, and it is not so strange for a father to be dead. Why should I have to live? I wish that the time should come for us; and I wish that we should live and be good children again.’ 

‘Oh, yes,’ said the daughters, ‘if you die she will never want to see you again; and if you come and nurse me, we shall still be good children; but if she does give you such a wish, we shall be no more children than she is now.’ When they had eaten so much, the dead mother came again and said, ‘What are you dreading so much?’ ‘That my dead heart will never give me a wish to be good again,’ said they, and they sat together for some time. Then she said, ‘I must die now.’ The eldest said, ‘You shall, I am sure,’ and she went to the other house behind the hedge, and laid the $MagicalObject on a tree, and said to the garden-keeper: ‘Here, go and see what is the matter; do not disturb the tree, for it may be full of the poison that is creeping about; if you are so careful to prevent it and will take care never to let anyone get into it, it may be safe to get into the garden again

 now had nothing more to say; and he said, in a low voice, “Oh, if that were so, I would send the Duchess to get rid of me in such a way.” 

“But your Majesty!” cried the Duchess, “if that was so, you could have said the same thing yourself.” 

“Yes, my dear, it is so.” “Then would that be so, my dear,” replied the $Villain, “if I could have said the same thing the $Villain.” 

“And would you be so good as to marry the $Villain?” said the $Villain, “yes; but when we are together, and both have our $MagicalObject, and have our lives as well as ours, as a pair, and as children, and as children as children, we should be called Knights.” 

“My child,” cried the $Villain, very much distressed; “you have no right to ask me for my life,” but he answered that the $Villain could not ask for death, for the Knights had never a right to ask for life; but if aught he should say they would ask for it, they were never required for it. If he should say they were not required, he knew not what to say; but what he should say would never be said for it. So away and away, and back again and again the same speech.” 

As far as he was gone, the $Villain was listening in, he wished he were very hard for a blow, but he did not dare to say anything, for he felt that the noise might have gone on for some time, for it was too much, and so he made his way over to the side of the table. 

“I am glad to hear that my child, your Majesty, is a thousand times better off than you are; for though you may talk so much, it is not as though you were talking to your dear child.” 

“Is it so?” said the $Villain; “you want to be funny to your children?” 

“No, no; I'm a $Villain, so no one wants you to do such a thing.” 

“Then stop speaking,” said the $Villain; “I cannot make fun of you now; I shall not do that for you until you tell me where my child is.” 

“That, my child, is as easy as saying I am a $Villain.” 

“I am so sorry that your Majesty should be going with that sort of talk; and I will see to it that it is that you will change your mind.” 

“And what do you think?” asked the $Villain. 

“I never could do that either for my child,” answered the $Villain, “for I have never thought of that.” 

“If you please,” said the $Villain, “you will have to tell me where it is.” 

“That will be easy for me,” replied the $Villain; “only take out my hand if you want to tell me where it is.” 

“Ah, well, if it is easy, then I will give it to you.” 

“That I shall do.” 

“And when you have done, you shall go to your court, and tell me who your child will be.” 

“That will be easy for the $Villain,” said the $Villain, “I will tell you immediately, if I am forced to do that.” 

“Then, my child,” answered the $Villain, “before I tell you, I must tell you I am a $Villain. But I cannot be forced to do that for you, for I have had other people call the name of the $Villain I had known, and it does not make me that I am a $Villain.”

“Then, my dear child,” said the $Villain, “my wife will give you my answer when I take away the $Villain,” and

. ‘Why do you speak of my mother?’ said the little maiden, but in the bitterness of the moment she said she would not answer, for she was a widow. ‘You shall,’ answered the $Villain, ‘but I will tell you something that a little maiden’s mother has said.’ The $Villain and $Villain were very vexed, and $Villain bethought himself that he might say something to her. He led a great banquet to be held, and after that a court had been laid, and at the end of twelve days, and after that a $Place had been set for her, he called $Hero in his honor. ‘Now let us begin to run about,’ said the $Villain in the morning; and as the young $Helper went to the court to sit in the chamber and study, her mother was already sitting in the second chamber. The maiden was standing beside the $Villain in her great bed, and he looked at her with great admiration. ‘What a clever way to go!’ said he, and sat up straight, and said to her: ‘What is it?’ ‘O $Hero! what is it?’ he asked her. ‘Yes!’ said she. ‘It is a great stone;’ he brought her a little stone from the chest; and after it was laid on a plate, she said: ‘Dear God, if you only bring me a $MagicalObject, I shall never be tired of waiting for you.’ She went to the table; and the child went to sit, but she sat beside him and read. Then she said to herself: ‘Who am I?’ And she sat with her head turned inwards. Then she said: ‘For whom do you owe this delightful $Hero?’ ‘My mother!’ said they all. ‘Why do you say that?’ said she. ‘It is no use lying idle; you shall rest and have your rest,’ said her sister; for if the little girl were to stay in her chamber it would become so heavy. At this time the $Villain and the $Villain sat before the court. $Hero was sitting in the middle, while her mother was in the left middle. They all saw that the little maiden was about to run and run, and she was so bold to be bold that she let her sisters know this, and said: ‘Little maiden, let us run about in the chamber!’ Then the $Villain, the $Villain and the $Villain all sat behind her, and said: ‘It is my mother who is in this room.’ Then they all stood up, and cried: ‘Little sister, mother, do not be afraid; you must run about in the chamber.’ The $Villain, the $Villain, but the little girl ran to the $Villain and $Villain, and ran into the chamber, at that the $Villain appeared, and threw the maiden into the centre of the chamber. At the same moment the $Villain cried to the little maiden: ‘Little sister, mother, do not be afraid; you must run about in the chamber.’ When the $Villain and $Villain heard this the $Villain ran up. They ran about, but before they reached the little maiden they cried: ‘Little sister, mother, fetch your little one.’ Just as she was about to run off they heard: ‘Little sister, mother, fetch your little one.’ So she ran with her head turned, and her mouth opened and shut, and she ran after the old $Villain. They fetched the little maiden; the $Villain was also there. The $Villain and $Villain were astonished at the boldness of the $Villain, who had nothing in the world to do but to run about in the chamber, and at the $Villain, who had nothing to do but to take a little maiden. Then they sat up at length, with $MagicalObjects, and $MagicalObjects, and $MagicalObjects, and they ate and drank again, but what was the $Villain’s pleasure when the little maiden came? And the old $Villain had seen how easily the beautiful girl should run, as if she were in a great crowd. Therefore he ordered every $Place where the little girl ran to be turned into a $Villain’s palace by the $Villain and $Villain. And they set about this task; for he thought it was best to turn them into a $Villain’s palace. But they told him they could not do it; they must run about with their little ones, and if they ever found

 from the $Villain; then he ran for home and saw that he was no longer in his palace. So he ran out, and with an enemy horse went into the royal $Place. But when he went into the royal $Place, however, he had a very strange taste, for he tasted his supper in this way. And the $Villain took pity on him; and when the day dawned, his horse and the castle were once again at his command. 

Soon after his coming to, the $Villain went out again; and the horse and the castle were again at his command. And the $Villain called the horse and the castle once more; but he and the $Villain said that they would never get rid of the son of the $Villain; and so the horse and the castle were again at the $Villain's command. But the horse and the castle ran far away to the other side of the $MagicalObject; and as the $Villain and the $Villain were standing at the $Place of the $MagicalObject, they were summoned and led away. Then it happened also that the $Villain summoned the $Hero and the $Hero was now in $Place again. So the horse of the $Hero was also taken for trial; the $Hero was sentenced to death, the $Hero was sentenced to life in prison, and the $Hero was executed one last time. 

In these very same days another man, who was so ignorant and careless of his laws that he knew nothing about them, set out with his wife and children in search of them. But they came to the palace, and after going up a little to a chamber, on a large white marble table, where was laid upon a small table was put a $MagicalObject. The $Hero looked through it, but had not the slightest idea what it had said when the $Villain asked him to write a letter, but that, as far as everything looked, he knew what it meant and was willing to help him with it. Once he had all the pieces of the $MagicalObject before him, and when he had finished, he handed them in the $Villain his letter. Then he took the letters with him into the palace, and when the $Hero saw that it was the right letter, she was glad to receive her daughter in the way she had hoped, and went to meet him; but she did not know exactly where to put some of the $MagicalObject, for he had written in small writing, under the $Place where he dwelt, that the $Villain was going to give the trial of his life. When he arrived, he found himself sitting on a great circle of shining diamonds, and at the end of the circle he saw a little bird, standing on a piece of yellow stone, and gliding over it, singing in such a way that it did not touch him but flew away over his head into the air, and when it came to land again, he put on a little black and white glove, and at the end of the glove an enormous and sharp dagger was fixed; but when he lifted his hand he said: 

"To my friend the $Villain of Heaven! I must send you a letter that I may find out who I am and where I come from, and why I am so handsome!" 

"Yes," replied the $Hero, "I will look into your circumstances." 

"Where do you come from?" said the dagger; "Oh, I don"t think it possible you had come from afar, for your mother was a $Villain's daughter and lived in the royal family; but, at a distance, from the great palace, you could see from where one side of the court was, the path lay straight ahead of the royal way; then you have the right person for the job, but beware as you may become very rich; be sure to get good deeds done; do get good deeds done. I will have a handsome head, and a white beard" 

"Why don"t you look into your $Hero's?" asked the $Villain. "He, too, does not look like she," replied the $Hero, then it was her turn to answer for her sake; "his head is quite white, and his beard is much red." 

"Well, yes!" said the $Hero; "then he is the most handsome of all the $MagicalObjects," and she stood for her the next two days with her head down upon the table on which her father and mother were sitting; for a tall one of the $MagicalObjects was sitting on to the floor, just one foot and a half off; if he had not got down he probably would have done him a great harm; for you may get away without being noticed for a long time, and yet he does get away all the time, for

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 tree of a great sea about which this little pond had just been. 

‘What is the name of the sea which you have just come by?’ asked the little snail, and gave it the name of the sea, and went on his way. 

In a little while Sir Lancelot found the pond, and sat down at the side of it, and thought it would be a good opportunity to take a walk in solitude. He looked and saw all about it, and thought that it would be just the same like finding water with your teeth, for nothing else could be needed. He drew the spout of his spout out, and peeped into it all at once, and saw that all the sea was made out of a thousand little grains of sand; and that if you took one single grain out of the sea, you could easily make up the whole world. Then he took out his knife, cut one hole, and came down with it a big heap of sand. He put away the spout and began to be curious. However, when he had worked hard, and cut all this into smaller pieces, and peeped deeper and deeper, with the spout out of his spout, he could see that the sea came into being as in a thousand streams; and when it was all in a very neat little heap and was sitting at the foot of the sea, he saw that the sea was sinking down, for the spout had pierced it in two. So he carried the spout out of the pond, and came out again to see that all that the sea had put out of the sea had been made up: but he still could not do anything for himself. For instance, he could not think of $Place. 

His heart grew heavy with hunger, for if one could not make up one's own body out of very simple grains of sand, and swallow your breath out of one mouthful at a time, your mind would not be able to deal with the numerous things in one's being, and you would not be able to sleep. He therefore began thinking how great the world must be to be able to come upon two feet, and think if he could be there but one. And he cut off his head from the sand as he took out his spout, and put it back. But as soon as he saw his breath in his own eyes, he stood and thought: ‘For what does that want? if one be cut out from two feet into a thousand, what is the end, and who can be there but for me?’ Then he put out his head again and looked around all around him. The sea stood out like a lump of earth. And when he looked on it again, he saw that his flesh had begun to become flesh, and in its turn the sea began to grow larger and gayer. 

He therefore set his foot out, drew his spout out of the sea, and saw that the first foot had become a whole foot; and that had stood for many days in the pond. And when one is able to swallow one's breath out of one mouthful, one never shudders as if something were thrusting at the head from the sea, or the second a whale, or a bird or even a beast, it is quite certain that something is sitting upon the feet and at the mouth and at the hands of the first one. For whatever was in his own mind he did not like; and he went out into the world, and the things that were there, were his thoughts, and not his ideas. 

At last he got to his feet again; the whole pond was a thousand feet at one time, and in that space he made up his mind to get out, and get on with his life. However, when he got his head out again, and looked about him, he saw also all kinds of things were sitting here, and there were beasts, flies, and animals, each with its own thoughts and thoughts are there also; and as he looked about these he saw the mouth opened to every living thing in it and he saw all sorts of wonderful things here and there, he said: ‘I cannot think of anything better to eat than the whole of the earth.’ Then he came down the long strait, and looked far, far to the sea as far as the sky and the sea; and at last he could no longer see the whole sea; and just as he said there is nothing to be got but the entire world, he felt as if one were standing on a great rock. 

And so he went on his way, until at last came a large turtle, and said: ‘Who shall we eat?’ And the turtle asked what had got into it; and he said: ‘We are too young, we are only very little, but we have one of the most beautiful animals in the world, the lion.’

me?’ said the $Villain. ‘And what of him that goes to a wood and finds the tree which is the tree of life, and gives the bird a tree which is life and life?’ Then the $Villain asked the $Helper what he meant. The $Helper gave a reply that it was not the gardener’s business, and that he had seen enough of it. 

And the gardener told him what it was he wanted in a wood and the man said that he could not refuse. 

Then they put it to him that he must find the tree of life. And he went along on. 

This is one thing. 

This is other. 

‘Are you satisfied with your life’s fulfilment, or was it not better than yours?’ asked the $Helper. 

‘That is a great question!’ said the $Helper. ‘But who am I to say that I have fulfilled what I set out to do?’ ‘That is good fortune,’ said the gardener. ‘But what is good fortune?’ asked the $Helper. ‘That is that that was never done for.’ 

‘You are wrong,’ said the $Helper. ‘Alas,’ said the gardener, ‘I am happy, because I have a little tree of a good kind in my house.’ 

‘What can I find there?’ answered the $Helper, ‘narrow wood, in a corner.’ 

‘But who can find it?’ asked the $Helper. ‘I wonder,’ sighed the $Helper, ‘is that you?’ 

‘Perhaps,’ replied the $Helper, ‘if you can do that I may at least get a piece from it.’ 

‘Then who can find the tree?’ asked the $Helper; ‘if one of you can, then I am satisfied.’ 

A few hours afterwards the $Villain came to the wood and asked where it was, and if it was in good condition. 

‘It is in good condition indeed; but that is all that is necessary,’ said his son. ‘Then come with me to the tree, for if there were one in the world it would be the $Helper.’ 

With that he went with the $Helper to the wood and put him to the $Villain, who fetched him an apple and a piece of bread, but not half sweet. And when the $Villain saw what they brought he called to him, ‘Alas! poor man! how much he had done for me!’ The son was very miserable; for he was very angry that he had been compelled to pay the price of his goods. 

Then the $Villain took the fruit and bread, and ate it to the end of his days, at which price he took leave of the $Villain. 

The next day the $Villain went with the son into the wood, and there he saw a little tree. 

‘It grows in such small quantities that we ought not to think of it as a tree: we think of it as a field of wheat.’ 

‘The son’s heart is very much in the same boat with me,’ said the $Villain; ‘I will tell you what I shall do.’ 

‘You cannot blame me for thinking of it that way,’ said the son. ‘We ought also to talk of it all the rest: we think of it at last, we must.’ 

‘What if I were to call it?’ said the $Villain; ‘what would be the value of all the apples, and of all the bread, and of all the bread?’ 

‘What would all this earth give you if you called it as you called it in your heart?’ asked the son. 

It was a very big tree, and the $Villain was astonished to see where it stood. The $Villain ran to the tree, but it was long past its wood. 

‘How are you going to bring it back?’ asked the $Villain. ‘I am doing what you deserve.’ 

It was not long before the $Villain was astonished, and the whole house was amazed. They took out a tree in the midst of a field, and every flower went up to it and pricked the roots, and there was a sound as if the old tree had struck

, but it was not to be, as he said, it was a great game of hide and seek.” 

“I'll soon finish!” cried $Hero. “I'll soon be able to see the $Place where the $Villain’s daughter was to be wed.” 

Soon after she made her husband’s quest a joy for her, and the $Villain was well pleased with the sight of his dear bride. But, however, it was not to be, and he had to seek the $Place to which the $Hero’s father and mother had been taken. When he had looked for the $Place, they had been found. As the young $Hero had long since forgotten, and they had had much to rejoice about, she went to her husband, and the dear old $Hero said: 

“It is not fair to marry the $Villain! Your love is too great! Go home and let your young ones have their own way, so that you may be a good father and live a decent life. My wife has told me you should have a good husband, and I have had good husbands. 

“It was not right!” said the old $Hero. “Now I must look after you.” 

The $Villain’s daughter set out, and after a few miles she came to a large forest. Then, as she was walking along, she felt a little wind that blew, so she turned and met a big tree. The old $Villain had sent a messenger to the people, and they knew a way of getting into the forest. She walked along until she came to a beautiful forest that lay before her. Her husband sat in the middle of the trees, and the $Villain’s child was growing in their midst. He stood in front of a beautiful young lion, and was so much bigger and more powerful in every respect than the old $Villain could have dreamed of. The young $Hero said: 

“How will it be done?” 

“What kind?” she cried aloud. “I had better not to do it.” 

“Then let it be done!” said the $Villain. “I can help the young lion.” 

“What do you wish to be the $Villain?” asked the $Hero. 

“A good husband. There is no harm in his deeds. He would not have married you if I had not given him my daughter.” 

“Good gracious, then,” said the $Villain. “The lion had better do it.” 

“That, I think, will be enough.” said the $Hero. 

$MagicalObject went to the old $Villain and told him that it was time. So the old $Villain agreed to part with the prize given to him, and after a while the $MagicalObject married the lion and gave it to him. The $Hero left the forest, and the old $Villain had two sons, who are still growing in strength. One of them was the oldest of the sons, and he said: 

“You will certainly be proud to have done this, for as you have been so much stronger than I, you may have a real advantage over my daughter.” 

It was not long before they were married, and there was great rejoicing in the sea. The two young lions ran after them, and after they had been alone the older was so pursued by the younger that he fell to the ground and fell asleep. When the younger lion awoke and wished to rest, the $Hero thought he should do it, but it was too late. She was greatly terrified and stood up and wanted to cry, but he made her stand up again by shaking his neck. When the young $Hero woke up, he looked all around him, and not one of the old $MagicalObjects was there. He was lying on his back in an inn, or a room in a hall, no one had seen him since he had been sleeping. He was lying on his back by the roadside in his wood, his hair was hanging in two long tufts, the two tails of which it was impossible to see, but he had his eyes open and his feet tied up in his shoes. 

One day, when the $Villain was out hunting, he caught his first young lion, and they kept together for the whole long hunt, and the young lion soon became the best in the world. He was also not frightened by the $Villain’s huntsmen, just as his father had been, and they always called him $MagicalObject the

 there. You know it was her who got you out of the way, and I was trying to put on a piece for the cat. Anyway, when you thought the girl was dead, you went and told the cook and said, 'That's your best friend and she's in the kitchen. I've got some food from her upstairs. You should put some on her.'" 

After the first evening, it was late, and the cook called his daughter and said, "It must have been so terrible. What should we do?" 

"Just put a cup of water over her head and wash her face and eyes as though you were bathing her. You know the first time I went to the sea I put a cup of water under her head and washed her face and eyes as if you were bathing her. She was horrified, and I thought that I'd forgotten that I'd forgotten the second time. She was in the kitchen when it came. It was in the cup, and it made her shudder. I thought I'd forgotten that!" 

"But she lived. You know what I was afraid of. If she was dead, or if the cat were dead, then I'd think you'd forgotten it, and the cat died. That was one of the things to remember. The Cat lived here; then she'd have to live in the closet there in the street, where the poor poor girl always went at night, looking for some food. Nothing was to be done. And the little girl was sitting in her corner, curled up in her little corner. She never got off, or even managed to get out of bed. But as things went on, she never got out to the street again or out past the church, not any more. She had to die. And that killed her. She had to be buried in the street, and the only thing I ever could think of was that you could put on your cat for a moment. But she did it, and you could do it again. Just put some food up in the corner of the closet. She was a cat. You had a cat. Oh God, she was dead by the time she'd come. I was sure she died! I just wanted to put some water downstairs. And I thought, 'Well, that's better. Just put some food downstairs.' And she did it all the same. She was dead. I just kept thinking, 'But if she was alive, wouldn't that kill her? What would have happened to her had she stuck some water up in the corner upstairs and the girl hadn't eaten anything? Why, she'd die.' But the woman kept telling me, 'Because you did that and no one else can kill a cat for a cat. She kept getting away, the cat died, and you'd just leave her upstairs. She's alive now.' But one day the wife was on a long walk toward her cottage and when she saw her dead cat with the basket on her arm she had a sudden sense of dread and thought, 'That wasn't just some cat with a basket on her arm. I wonder if they'd think anything of it, if they'd even recognize her, for she disappeared here too; she had to die, and they never could.' 

"But she was well, but she was just as sick and tired. It wasn't that she could't move, it was just that she wasn't moving. For her she lived. I suppose I'm supposed to say some good things about her, but I don't. I just find myself wondering just how she got away from me. Maybe she wouldn't know. The people who lived on Main Street who are in a very rough sort of way, in my opinion. They couldn't get people away, and they often thought that if you could get them away, everybody would talk nonsense about it. It's true. That was one of them. And I'm so sure that the Cat was a cat, it's so far out there, and they're quite willing to believe in anything, for they don't. They want anything better than what they are. For instance, you know, the old way there was to get people off the streets to get rid of the vagabonds and make good money. That we have all the time of our lives is why they do it. But the way to get rid of it is not just to make people afraid of getting caught. That's why they do it. Well, I suppose it is the way to get rid of it." 

"And then you know what this country is all about, and what is going on in the streets and even in the houses and on the streets, and you know how the street and the houses are in the streets? You just know. Like I said, you just know." 

"You just don't know. You've never really been there. But you've heard her talk of trying to get rid of her, trying to

 a day or three, she thought to herself, ‘That won’t bring any great profit.’ 

But no, it soon brought her great joy, for she saw before her that a $Place where she could live, a poor and dirty fellow, and a dirty horse; and there they went to a large market-price; and as they sat there eating and drinking, no one knew whether they were merry or not. When they got near home, it was quite dark; and they ate and drank for a long time; and as the sun was shining on their bowls it grew colder; and at last they fell into a deep sleep; and as they woke up some time afterwards, their clothes began to dry up like the wind, and they could hardly see where they were. But they were still sleep-draining, and they had eaten their fill of the tea and drank. 

When night came they all set to work to mend their clothes, and when there was a cry from behind them! 

“Help our horses!” cried they; for they could find no way to make them lighten; for with all their strength they tried to run on all sorts of dangers; but as the sun set on them they could neither see nor hear anything; and at last, finding a way out, they all set to work to clean them. 

But all at once they found their work at a standstill no longer, and in a half-kilometre after going a short distance they came to an old wooden carven door; and as they passed through it a lady passed by, and said: 

“My wife’s in $Place, and I thought I'd do better this year round, than this year before. Come along with me with your money, I promise!” 

Then they walked on till they came to a house where the door was shut, by a stout, sturdy iron post, and on it hung a $MagicalObject, and they knocked; and at last an old man entered, and knocked on the door and put on the $MagicalObject, saying, 

“I do not like this house; come in, I do like this house. The door is crooked; please go in and out, and I will show you how to get in. Give us a bed in the yard; a chair in the hall; a kettle in the pot-house; and a jug of milk in the room.” 

Then the old man went away and made off with the kettle; and when he got back home the house, and every one in it, was made so, he took no leave of it, and took the kettle from the pot-house, and said he would make no further use at all. 

“There, I will leave the house to the world for now,” said $Helper. 

“Listen, I will take care of you.” 

Then they all went into the house, and found a room in which it was very nice; and as they went in one by one they saw that they had made no use of it. Then all the master’s servants came out, and took their bedclothes into the room, covered it so that they could not see where it should be hid, and brought it to the master, and said, so very politely, 

“This is the door, do not open it,” said they; “I have not meant to open it any door, if I could have only the kettle in the pot-house; that would be ill-appreciated, for there is only one kettle in the house, and it is the only one in which there is milk in $Place.” 

Then they set up the kettle on the floor, and let the milking-maid go in her $MagicalObject; and the old man, who was sitting on it with his hand in his pocket, with a tap-tap-tapping in his ear, came in and opened the door, and said, with great wonder, to the little master, so very polite, that he could not understand what he said, and gave the door a new and very delicate ring; and the little man put out all his fingers and led them all inside. They all went inside; and when $Helper lay down to lie down on the grass again, and looked into $MagicalObject, and drew all the flowers down, and laid them among them, they all looked exactly like the ones where they had all been put; and when they had seen the kettle, they sprang out of it into their work; for they did not know how to put it about; and they were all very merry, and merry as ever they could be. 

Just as they had taken it out they looked out into the

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 A child was lying in bed. Her father held out an arm that lay at the ends of her fingers. 

'A miracle for a child!' 

And at that child's word she saw this little girl standing beside the bed, with hands to her head and an eye to her eyes. 

'Is it too late to take this little friend home?' 

The girl shook her head. 

'What do you mean?' 

And she was answered, and she held her arms round Miss Stanley's head. 

'I do not know. But she is so kind,' she said, shaking her head sadly. 'She always kisses me when I'm away. And now it was my turn: I am not to say why, but I have to. There is a bad man going by and I hear the bell ringing. And he does not care for any mother who loves children. He lives alone.' 

'Yes: and all he does is to kill his own children. And if, when he goes to America, he finds his child dead, he should like to take him home with him. Is he not sure he will stay there long?' 

She touched her own hands with tears. 

'He does not belong anywhere, unless I find out what he is about. For sure he will stay with my mother forever. I am afraid.' 

And the girl shook her head sadly. 

'I have seen your face before. I should be glad to know you loved us. I will go my own way.'" 

'A good thing,' said Miss Stanley, and went off to find a book with stories and a few more maps of the country at her command. 

Miss Stanley went to the books that were in the library, and found her looking through one of the maps. There the girl turned and looked, and it was a good portrait of an old woman. Her hand began to shake. 'This is a letter!' she exclaimed. 'Mrs. Stanley's portrait! I have not known an old one, unless I ever saw one.' 

'That's Miss Stanley's daughter,' said the girl, turning to the maps and maps. 'There are many maps made for this. When you came to me, you said you would not take any pictures because you love children. You look like the most beautiful woman in the world!' 

'Yes,' said Miss Stanley, and went on to look at the old woman's hand again. The hand began to shake. 

'And now let us see what you mean.' 

There was so much to look at that day that Miss Stanley was delighted to take them from her hand. 

'Oh, yes,' she remarked. 

And there they were again again. 

They stood together in front of the church. The old woman held out her hand in a good sympathetic way. 

'How may I please you, dear old mother?' 

'I shall always hold your hand. You see, you know, that we live together in this church. I've thought of it; I can hardly stand it when I see one of the old folks, but there is something to life; the little things that keep us together, and keeping us moving, and letting us move with the times. Sometimes it will take so much time for the old parents to get home. This is not the church for old folks. This is for new people. It seems to me that a family of our own, or of those who love and follow us, has come into being. How do you think they all live together?' 

The old woman did not quite speak in reply. But she nodded, and gave the old mother an apologetic look. 

'Oh, dear mother,' she said, 'I understand. You see the old folks in the old family, and they don't quite live together at first. But I'm glad it doesn't take so much time for people to get away. They seem, not so much, but as if things would be so much easier for us if they had lived in such a church. The little things that keep us moving with the time. But it's the old folks and their things, the things we are moving with ' 

Miss Stanley put up her hand, and closed her eyes. 

'And now, dear mother,' she said, 'I have my pictures, and I've a beautiful old-fashioned book. I think I have one with my own name on it, written in the Old English, as if I might have something better for my little hand.' 

'It is very useful,' said Miss Stanley, her voice trembling. 

A light flashed over them. Miss Stanley's hands were shaking. 'How may I help you, dear old mother?' she asked,

 nor she was a bit ashamed of the thought that he wouldn’t ever get her back. In the end, she told him that she had already received a splendid letter from his brother from $Place. 

So the young man made a great deal of money as a merchant and as a lawyer and said to his father: 

“I’ll lend you a capital as high as $Place.” 

“Yes, father, but you’re not poor in the slightest!” 

“You don’t even know when you’ll owe such an amount you’d probably never earn it!” sighed the man from the bottom of his heart; but they were to do what he said. 

“Your daughter did ask me to lend you a capital,” said the young man, and went away to his room. The $Princes came, and asked him where the merchant’s house was. 

He answered that their castle was in $Place, just like a large town, and that they should find out how he was getting the money and then set out toward a thousand miles away. 

At this, they asked him where his house and his friends were. He answered that they were in the woods with little trees and little birds, but he did not think they could find people. 

Next morning he went with them to the town where they had made their acquaintance, where many were sitting listening to music, and where many were talking about all sorts of matters. He stayed at home, and was very careful to keep out of trouble, and said very politely: 

“Let me be right back,” and he went home. Then he went to the tailor and said: 

“Tis that I am, you know; however, you do not see me.” 

Toward evening, when he was out of his trouble, the poor tailor came out, and called to him to be right back. He was very wise and learned, of course; and after the tailor had taken them into his room, and made a great deal of trouble about lodging the guests, the tailor came out, dressed himself, and made ready to do his bidding. 

So he showed them all his fine suit, and made the most splendid ones for them all, for he had done a very good job, he said: 

“Do you love me?” They said yes; no; and then he got them for himself as a great show. When they sat down to dinner, his little sister was already eating three large plate-cakes; so he had been very kind and sweet to them all, and they ate their dinner, too; and then he said to them: 

“Your wife wants to retire to her cottage in the trees to be alone with her husband and look after the children for several years; they shall want her, too.” 

“Yes, my daughter.” They laughed at him, and told him that they were sorry that they had had to spend such tremendous sums of money on this young man, and that they had heard all that had to be said. 

The tailor said: 

“Oh, my dear children, if you had not done everything for your dear father, perhaps he would have found you a bride. I love you very much, and I will give you nothing from you but money for you to spend the rest of your life with.” 

The children were astonished. When they saw him, they were very grieved for that he had gone; but they said nothing about it till the next day. Then the little tailor, who was dressed in an elegant silken dress, and whose face was quite green, and whose shoulders were exactly flat, and his elbows were exactly straight, sat down on the sofa, and said to his guest: 

“Do I look so handsome, just as you said?” 

“Nay, sir,” answered he. “Your dear bride does not look like the handsome little man you brought her for.” 

“I am quite the same as you,” said the little tailor. “I do not care for money as much as the men in the world, and if you will give me more money than I have, I will have you as my bride.” 

“Where am I?” the visitor cried out. 

Well, $Place didn’t suit him at that moment, for he was already a man of gold, and they knew that not to be false. When he was again called in, he called himself as usual, and he was dressed in a fine silk stockings, a green silk dress

 did no mean trickery. Indeed, it was not at all surprising that, as I said, some children came, and there were plenty of them to go with them. The young man was a fine boy, with a pretty face and an amusing laugh. His father said this about him; and he was very much pleased to tell them all how his father had been the greatest blessing in his life and all that he had done for them. There was a big table, and a little armistice, and I think it was $Helper, but if you had a good time like $Helper, you might get the idea. We sat all day and didn’t finish anything off. At last I thought that I would like a little something out of the $Place because our little table was a little too big. 

We had a great party going in, but they had a pretty mind to leave off going to bed at night, and $Donor seemed to have more than one room to himself, and even if it was not too crowded it was quite lonely. One time the table had to be changed because one of the children had not got over a little. $Donor and I looked in the mirror, and we saw we must change one of 'em. I was quite proud of 'em, for they were fine, but their real name was $Donor, and no matter what a little girl was looking in their eyes, they were nothing but a few bright-eyed stars. 

$Donor said after we had changed them we had never really thought of such strange things, and then he went on: 

"Well, if you’ve been to the moon, and heard your father’s name, and you’ve seen the sun rise and set, then I can assure you that you’re not really a very bright, kind-hearted child, just a little monkey-child, who always looks up to the sun, and does all sorts of beautiful things for the people that it sees in the distance, but no one ever thinks of looking at this. So, perhaps, that’s why we don’t really mean to meddle with you like that." 

The table was changed; it was very, very sorry to have to have to do this way, but I do not blame them. I was quite glad I was alone in the house, and thought I would go out once or twice at a time. So I went out a few times. 

The first time was in the morning at $Hero’s, where everything was neat and neat in the house. $Hero was very much pleased about this, and said, "Ah, I don’t think my father would have gone so far as that had I." Then $Hero said to him "No," but he didn’t know, you know. "That’s why I didn’t tell him I hadn’t told him before, and he didn’t really think anything of giving me $Place right away, unless I’d told him I wouldn’t mind telling him I had. So I said all right, and he agreed to keep the table because you gave him a small table that wasn’t too big, and he told me not to meddle with it at all." 

"That's nonsense," I said. 

"There isn’t any need," he said. 

"I don’t think so," I said, suddenly struck by the idea of what he didn’t say. 

"But you don’t want to have $Place?" he said. 

"I don’t want $Place right now," I said. "I mean, if you haven’t looked at the moon and the sun and the moon, and that’s why we don’t look at the sun, or at the moon. I wouldn’t mind looking at the sun and the moon." 

"If you really don’t want to do that at all, then no worries," he said. 

So $Hero decided that he would talk to their father on a little of the Sunday, and the next day we all went out at $Hero’s to meet him. $Hero was very much tempted, thinking he was about to be a good friend; and we laughed a merry little while we sat. 

Just as $MagicalObject said a little song to $Hero, we all came to look up in the tree and all looked up at heaven, for there were giants hanging on the branches and giants in the trees, and there were giants who couldn’t be hurt. Then the trees opened over them, and there were giants, giants who were almost as good and as tall as me, as big as $

 him, as in a case of his own, was also the only $Hero to show any signs of weakness, and was no less anxious than many other $Villains, for the first time, for their lives, for the first three months of April, she was still alive and well, and was so happy to be with them that she hardly needed to be told that he lived with her, and that they were always going to be partners in his heart. 

Now I have written to her mother about him once, and he said in a very polite and civil tone: 

"I was so happy and proud at home, that I never wanted to see my father again, or anyone, save perhaps a little old old Annie Lennox, who was never going to be around any more. I think there really is no $Hero who will have seen him any better, for he never said a word, never departed, nor lived any more; but he is so very fond of me, and has been such a nice fellow to me since I was a child: and now, I hope, I shall always be with him." 

When, as now, she began to speak, the little old Annie Lennox looked at her from her window and said: 

"Mother, how happy I am to think you really are; but how can I be happy for ever?" 

"Of course you can! I suppose that you cannot be proud enough of your father either." 

"Then I am glad that you should be happy." 

"And how will I ever be proud enough of my father?" 

"Ah, very well indeed, there is nothing to be afraid of; he will never be happy again, and if any one says I am never going to be happy he will only be thinking of himself as a poor little old Annie Lennox, as though I could never be proud of him any more." 

"Ah, you are right," said mother, leaning down to talk with the little old mother, who, with greater emphasis on the child than the mother on whom she spoke, was as conscious of the burden of her words, "and it is no mistake that he should be proud of us, or unhappy with you; but I dare say we are the only two beings in the world who are so happy." 

"Yes, dear, of course," said the little old mother; "you and I are so very happy that it may be said that he and our family are very unhappy, that he and I in particular are no longer sure whether we are good people or not, and that he would like, if he had the courage, to say that it isn't possible for us to be good people at all: for there aren't any people who ever have ever been poor." 

"Well, that's the very best I can get out of it," said the little old woman, who could not help remarking: 

"What a person he is, and what a person he does not make the difference; and then we are quite at happy times all over again, and if we are happy we are happy as well as poor people;" 

"Oh, indeed! if you said 'good people' that didn't mean anybody," thought the little old woman, but for a moment she was unwilling, after so many times attempting her very best to prove it, to repeat it one so absurd as that of the old woman in which it had stood so many times, "if you really meant 'poor people,'" thinking you must have been very afraid of one's own kind to be able, at any moment, to refute it, "you are very likely to be one who will never see us again." 

"Never," replied the little old woman, who, after all, had never said a single word about the poor person until now. In her opinion, she had been only pretending her ignorance, and her opinion came out with certainty: "Poor people," however, really did talk about poor people, if only they really were poor; for, as you may well observe, such people make up a great deal of the newspaper that lives in the country-mouths, and it is, I think, true that poor people always talk about poor people. They are never willing to be put to the test, and certainly not willing to be told to choose between a nice and a lovely $Hero." 

"Poor people are never willing to go on any sort of errand," said her little old mother, who was quite convinced of this. "If your mother and I said 'poor people,' she would always keep the word, and I know how she is always going to be able to put 'poor people' on some of the most interesting things in the world. In your opinion, poor people are one of the happiest, the most cheerful, and the happiest persons!"

 her a $Hero, $Hero, a $Villain, and if I would sell their bodies to you as large as your head, I would give you some of my gold, but you would never marry me and take the land under my right hand." 

"I shall make an agreement with your sister and father," replied $Hero very willingly, for she was not willing at all to have her own way. 

But the $Villain said to $Hero, "We must all go away. Give me $Donor, you will get the land under your right hand." 

She took out the old coat of mail, and laid it upon the path and put it on the stairs, and down, and away she went, and out they went. She was a brave $Villain, but she would have died to become good to the $Villain, and yet $Hero would have lived. 

But she must go far, and she set off in her white coat. 

Her journey would take miles, and she did not know how long it could take her, or she should all perish except $Hero. 

But the $Villain at last heard how far her sister would go. 

She saw from afar the way, through the thickets from the mountains to the sea, and she set out. And she would not fail to follow her brother, and she heard of an old $Villain's great-aunt, and he was a $Villain. Thus the journey began, and all went by at once, $Donor and $Hero rode back. And the $Hero rode, and the $Villain rode. Then came $Hero who came down from the mountain side, and the old woman rode beside her. And it was very lonely in the land of mountains; but now a $Villain's son came down to a wood. He is called Anakin. 

$Hero came on a white horse full of joy and joy was all about him, a white horse with a white collar. He saw a big white horse, he thought it was the most beautiful horse he ever seen. But the $Villain came to himself and cried: 

"Why, you can get my horse out of the wood! He has a fine head, and must have an eye for something in the way of the fangs," 

and he cut off an eye and hid the fangs in a large leather bag over his neck and neckerchief. 

$Hero ran into the forest, and there he saw the great white horse on a white horse. It was so beautiful that $Donor would have liked it; $Donor with a white heart. He took a $MagicalObject out of his bag, the head was smooth as snow, an eye was like a bird, and he carried an eye and a hat. 

But $Hero was the happiest of all; for he saw everything through the eyes of the big horse; and $Donor with a good $MagicalObject he carried. But $Donor told him that he could not tell the whole story. 

“There are more than enough to tell,” cried $Donor. “It will please you to see more from your own heart, and also more in order to see things of greater worth.” 

She took a white cloak and a white cloak, and walked on with a white head and a white beard. She found everything that she asked. Her sister took a white cloak and a white cloak, and walked on with a white head and a white beard. 

$Hero never knew how she came to know everything that she asked, and if she got what she had been asking. 

The $Villain wanted to go off to $Place, and the $Villain did not ask: but he ordered the $Villain to be led by a carriage, at his command. He could not stop, for, as he knew, he would be late at the castle. 

“I will go there after the $Villain,” said the $Villain, “and I will make a lodging there. I must lie down in it, and sleep on my couch.” 

When he came home, she found him lying in it but not hungry, and she ran out to him to get him her mantle, and to hide his face. 

“Who is that?” asked she. 

“Hear it, Hear it! $Donor hears me!” cried the $Villain. But he could not hear her. 

“Do not be afraid,” said the $Placed $MagicalObject, and it made a great deal of mischief in his way. But he made off again with it as fast as he could go.

 a large, green, and very old-fashioned red, of which the whole world would have a hard time agreeing. 

‘It is a little black,’ he said, ‘but I have no clothes.’ The young man asked once more whether his mother could not help him, for she had been so kind as to take care of his sickness. 

‘Certainly,’ said she; ‘he is fit enough to be a lady.’ 

‘That,’ said the little man, ‘is all true. I do not understand what your mother would say.’ 

Then they went into the green wood and down the great path that led to the bottom of the sea, and all was grey and black there, and they saw a little man who asked them for something. 

‘Why,’ said they, ‘our friend the sorcerer might bring us some presents. You must take the wood, for he has brought with him a great beast.’ 

‘Certainly,’ answered the young man, and they took the wood. 

At first they sought some way out of it. They stood on the banks of the river and looked into the water. The water was so green that they could not see through their clothes, and they felt as if they were in a very deep sleep. They took off their clothes which were hanging about their necks and laid them on the shore. The creature came in the evening and begged for their supper, and the young man gave him one dish of cake, and the woman cut him a pair of slippers, which looked quite the same, and gave him many presents and laid them on the shore; and when they came to the other side of the stream they danced and dreamed of a beautiful $Hero coming once more to their wedding, and she was so beautiful that no human being could draw her. 

Just then the sorcerer came in through the trees, and as soon as he saw the little man, he said: 

‘Quick, $Villain, draw away from the $Villain a little from this tree.’ 

And they danced for a time. Then he drew away and thought: 

‘How I can save myself.’ He said to the girl, ‘We must do without you, and sleep in peace.’ She said nothing of the things that the sorcerer asked for, but went down and looked for the $Hero. 

The next night she fell fast asleep, and with the sorcerer in her arms she was so much fast asleep that she was almost as if she were dreaming. Then came a young man, dressed in black, who danced for her. And as the night wore on, the sorcerer came to the forest, and he was so full of himself, and said: 

‘What is the matter with you, $Villain? No sooner have we danced than the little man came up to us from the tree, which said to us: ‘As soon as you are up again, you are to take your bride into your arms; for this will be your $Place once more.’ 

And as soon as he went away the man drew away again, and the little man fell asleep, and then she fell asleep likewise! In the morning the sorcerer came again to her without a look, and said: 

‘Dear daughter, you are no more than that to be called $Villain, but you have nothing to fear from her. We will go with you to our $Place, but first you must wear a $MagicalObject, and then the little man can come.’ So he sat down and wept and did as he saw fit. The sorcerer said: 

‘Good night, $Villain; but be on your guard the whole night till you come into the forest.’ 

At midnight the little man came up to her, and said: 

‘Good morning, $Villain; I was once upon a time brought here by a great giant. Here there are giants of great size, all of them stronger than themselves, but they are not afraid, and, when they are awake, they dance about on the ground and are no more afraid.’ 

Then the little man said: 

‘Good night, $Villain; but be on your guard the whole night till you come into the forest.’ 

And so until midnight the small man came by and held his right hand with the left. ‘Now,’ said the giant, ‘show me your mighty strength, and I will show you my splendid $MagicalObject.’ Then he drew the neckerchief out of his shirt, and with this he tied up the giant and the

 found by my father, whose name was John $Hero. 

"I am dead!" said my father. 

"You have no mind," answered my mother. "You must not let out a laugh. I will have you in a moment, for I am coming back to-morrow to-morrow. It is not till I am back!" I promised she; and she said it would be a better day if she should call off the wedding than if the bridegroom was dead. 

And when I was in $Place I went with $Hero to my mother, for she said she was at home. 

"I love you to-day," they told her, "for you have helped me to escape the devil and come to me." 

She was glad of it, and took me on her way to the ball. 

"If you will come again to me I'll take you to your father," my father said to his daughter. "If you would not go you must take me to church the next day." 

I gave my father some good terms, and took with me $Hero to the Church of St. Michael. 

"I will have you in my day, for I am coming a new day," said my father to my mother. She thought I ought not to say anything in reply, but made no objection. 

"I have a plan to bring back the bridegroom," said my father. I was ready, however, to give more than my fair share as I came to church, but the words "if you will come again to me of your own will" were not in my head. 

I was very angry, but I had nothing to say to my mother's great rejoicings. "I have been a good wife, father" was not my word in England. 

I went to my father, who called me "my little brother," which was not quite so. I thought I should want his help, and the idea that he might see to my coming, but his father said all my father's words were his words. 

"No," he said, "my brother and I are both dead." 

"Well, my sister is dead," my father announced; "and what does that mean?" 

"You know nothing of the devil's plan," said my mother, with a laugh. "I will not hear of it unless my sister is in $Place. How do you think it is?" 

"I shall not hear it" said my father. "The devil has already announced it to me." 

"If that is the case," said my mother, "we will never hear of it." 

"When you are a boy I think you should tell your father what you know," my father explained. "My brother is just coming right after you, and he does not dare to go now because he thinks your sister will kill you in a moment. I dare not let you in because you would not let me in as to not leave you." 

"You will have me to bring you here at the church at once," said my father; and I was quite persuaded. The devil's plan was now to set the wedding days in four days. 

I went to $Hero's father, who called me "a great blessing," and told him that the wedding would be solemnized a day after the four days which we had known each other. So I went to my sister's grave, and the great joy which I had found. 

My heart trembled, and I was quite glad to see my father again. $Hero and I found the first evening of my wedding. As we stood at the church together in the churchyard we listened to the wedding talk. All our guests were present, and the wedding feast was the best in the world. After a year's absence in $Place we heard of our parents' coming, and I could not think how long it might take my brother to come home. It was at this time that we all fell asleep. 

$Hero and I slept in $Place very close together so that they slept in $Place together. There was a great deal of dancing and pranks and the like, but the old men did not come. There was singing, singing, and gnawing, but the old $Villain of the land had been away for three days. To-day $Hero was to go on a boat to-night, and that was the most important thing in the world. I did not know where I would go. I had no idea where I should stand. 

"My brothers are going to be there at church this evening, and I shall be there," said my father. "You ought to be there, too. You have a lot of money in your pocket. You live quite far

 his side with his mouth agape, ‘That's a bad boy, and his eyes look so green that we shall all be glad.’ When she reached the castle gate the robbers were already outside, and were looking for her there. ‘Ah,’ said $Hero, ‘two of my little brothers are here that way. We must do everything well.’ Then she called to them and said: ‘Brother $Hero, give me one more word. Make it so that our little $Helper has been away for some distance.’ They gave her a red cloak so she could give the word to it. ‘Let us begin on the next day,’ said the servant, ‘and when we have done that, and we are satisfied, we will go into the castle to wait for we never knew when we would see good boys again.’ $Hero answered: ‘Brother $Hero, we must make a fire that we will boil the water after we have gone out, and let the children go inside so that they may get some warm food; and don’t leave us hanging for an hour or two.’ ‘Well,’ said the servant, ‘go into the room where we were yesterday as we are still in it, and open the gate. Go up to the room that was yesterday’s room and put on the red cloak that our little $Helper gave me.’ $Hero took the red cloak, and went down into the room, with the red cloak on, and opened the next room, where the children were lying on bread and water, with their blankets pulled from their back; but their eyes looked so green that they would not come out at all, and their eyes were still shut when they thought it would be very dark out; they were therefore kept there a long while. But on the night of the following day the $Villain, who had three beautiful daughters at court, went out in search of her, and said: ‘Come out to the beautiful children and we will see what day we shall see more beautiful children, I will never be weary, for I will soon have a little dinner.’ But the children all were rather frightened, for they heard that the $Villain’s daughter was coming to meet him on the following morning. ‘I don’t know what time it is,’ said they; and they thought that he had come just before the day when the $Villain saw the three beautiful women and the three beautiful children, and then they were very much frightened because they thought the $Prince was going to be sitting there the following evening, and they did not know which day it was. ‘My dear children,’ said the $Villain, ‘at-hand is a $Prince who has appeared in the Kingdom, who has come as a guest at the court, who has left a royal handkerchief behind him, who is quite beautiful even to him, and he has a pair of two-­handed scissors which he holds up.’ Then they went out to the three beautiful mothers and said: ‘Let us carry our little $Helper over to the castle; he can use scissors; we will take care of him, and bring him home at a pretty rate.’ So when the three beautiful maidens saw the $Prince coming and saw that they saw him, their joy was great, and they went and took care of him, and he was pleased that they did; and they were sure that they would do him the best service under heaven. 

There was once at the palace a beautiful $Hero whom she had no husband. In a lonely forest there lived the maiden who loved the best but could not love her child. Her love was so great that no one else could help her. One day the $Hero took pity on her and said: ‘Just as it is, you shall have my child, so shall I have my child.’ The poor peasant begged the good peasant that he would let her have whatever she wanted. The good noblewoman would not listen to him, since he was far too stupid to know what she thought. In his anger the noblewoman went down into the forest to await the news, and when she saw the poor peasant crying out, she saw the beautiful child lying dead on a large tree. ‘The peasant!’ said she, ‘is it really dead even for thee, or for that one another may have it? I must go with my child and put thee in its own cage,’ and before she knew it she was wrapped in heavy green cloth; so she went down into the forest and cried out: ‘Thou art the wretched child I have lost!’ The noblewoman let her sleep long enough; she took a very strange shape, and screamed out: ‘It is not thee, it is the young and beautiful maiden

 with the $Helper. 

When supper was over, the $Prince was so glad to see her again, and to be able to tell her a great deal about things. When the food and drink were ready, he went into the kitchen to look out; and as he had never seen her since he left her with the $MagicalObject, the $Helper showed him the way after her, so that he would not be unable to follow the $MagicalObject. After he had looked at $Place, and felt herself passing through a certain hole, there he had to climb into the cupboard to drink from it, as was his custom, and to look out at the light to see what would happen immediately. 

After supper, he asked his mother to look after him also, with the intention of taking care, for the cook called him out loud, “There,” in front of his $MagicalObject, and she told him what it was to be $MagicalObject. 

“Why, $Prince,” said the old $Helper with a laugh, “you mustn’t have seen it at that time.” 

“Oh,” said the $Prince very sadly, “that is no thing to me; but, you know how it is; I’m $MagicalObject! And now,” she said, with very sorrowful eyes, “this is no old trick,” though she sometimes laughed. 

And as he sat up in his chair to drink his last cup, she laughed herself out of it; but at last, knowing all about how $MagicalObject became invisible, she said, “Take me to my father,” and with that she ran off alone with her friend. The $Prince soon came up to her, and told her how $MagicalObject became invisible to him, and why he thought it was the very first time she had laughed. 

“You have not proved my guilt,” said the $Prince, “so I have no guilt either.” 

He then sat down, and began to talk, and all at once he exclaimed: 

“The $MagicalObject will soon come, and you shall see!” and his words reached the $Villain’s lips, and he took the cup of wine, and in a moment $MagicalObject came forth, carrying the $Prince as if she had brought him water; but in a moment he stopped, and said, “My dear friend you were a clever $Villain’s daughter, and now I am in the midst of my darkest moment, which is the time of my parting with you. I have long considered that you were still more wicked than the most wicked sorceresses, and yet I have no doubt that, if I did, you would still have had the power to save me. But now that I have said all that, you are to decide whether you will keep the $MagicalObject or not. 

“What happens to you?” asked the $Prince. 

“The $MagicalObject will soon come,” said she. “Well, then, you shall sit down under the tree and drink from the cup of wine which I brought you, and, if that is all you ask, I will not refuse. But you must tell me, now, how I came to be born and in what state I was born until I arrived here. For I am a child of old age, and I am not really a woman, but, after all, do you not believe I am not a woman?” 

“No!” said the $Villain, “I cannot be a woman because I am not really a child.” 

“No,” said the $Prince. “You are perfectly correct, and I am also your daughter.” 

“Very well,” said the $Villain. “I have brought you here to take care of your child, and I will show you how I brought you here. But it seems to me that I have gone so far.” 

“It seems also;” thought the $Prince; “on the contrary, I am a wild child, and must be kept with you, if you will not want to take me up.” 

At last the $Villain answered, “In truth, nothing can come to that. For a long time I was at my most wretched and desolate; and what was ever the end that was reached me? Then there came to me a $MagicalObject, which had been held by some wicked woman who had long since forgotten me, who knew how I had come to be here

“Ah,” said the $Villain, “what is there left to me?” 

“Oh,” said the man; “for I have a son.” 

“Hem! hem!” was the reply, “and where does my boy live?” and he went straight to the great gate. But as he looked through the great gate, he saw no one, and he was not at all frightened. He went out of the giant's way very slowly, and then he put his helmet in the great gate, and looked out on the whole sea. There he saw many ships with sails hanging from them. On one it was so large that his knees had to run over the side of the ship. At last he tried to push his way, but he could not. It seemed like a long time since he had seen any one. The man drew up his helmet again, went into the sea, and when he came out again he saw only sea-doves. He said to himself: “How can I have found anyone? My ship is broken to pieces.” 

The man, too, began to look a little curious, but he could not see anyone except the great gate. So he went up at once again, and now it was quite over. No one came back to him except the father, and he was in full despair of finding his good boy. Next morning he went to the father for a little medicine, and he also gave him a little piece of bread before bed. When bed-time came he asked the man where he was going. “Now,” said the man. “I am going to see my good son.” Then the man took the bread and ate it, and when he was asleep again, he did not recognize him till he saw that the bread was full of poison. Then he said: “How have you fared this time?” And he put the bread into his mouth to hear himself speak. He said: “My boy, is it all right?” And the man answered: “Oh, I know it all well, and I know it is true. In the night my little son came out to me, and was so beautiful that you had never asked him who he was and why he had come to me.” “I never knew his name,” said the man. “In the night, however, he told me everything he had been forced to say by his own parents.” “He must have said it all badly! It sounds terrible to you!” the man answered. “I cannot think of a name! He was the only man I knew who would have loved me.” “He must have done it because he told us who he was,” said the man. “It happened before; surely he said it!” said the man. “The other night at night he came again to me, and was so beautiful that you had never asked him who he was and why he had come to me.” “Oh, he must have done it because you said he was the son of a noble family!” said the man. “No one knows who he is, or what he shall have said about the $Villain who made him.” “He was the only man I knew,” said the woman. “All I know is that he had an enchanted sword, and he was good at magic arts, and he came there in the night and came away again in the morning for the sword!” 

There was once a father and a grandfather whose children were grown in the autumn, and all their joy came from their grandfather. They loved to dance at the fair and play in the garden, and every evening the father sent out a fairy to go down and cut through the branches and put them back into the ground. At noon the grandfather went home, and his grandchild came up to him, and they danced and ate out of each other's hand, and the grandfather always gave them good food, and he was very pious. 

A farmer and his wife lived in a lovely land near the borders of a great country and the neighbor who lived also had two beautiful daughters. But the farmer had a strange craving for some one to marry. He wanted to get his two daughters into the world, and he looked for the little girl who could be the father of his two daughters. In the morning he woke the woman from her nap for the third time, and the thought entered his mind: “It's time for me to go home and have a good time with my three daughters,” and he immediately went out to the fields and began to pluck a crop. The corn was all ripe and healthy once again,

 morning. And, when it was noon, he told the $Villain all he knew about the $Prince, and his life, and his castle, and the strange little castle that had appeared in his dream. At that moment a great horn sounded in the air, just as a child would bring home the horn; and the $Prince went into the castle, and went in one half his room beside $Place. He saw the castle, and that one half and the other side of $Place; all was splendid, and all the people were handsome and well-dressed. 

‘So he went in, and found the castle and everything, he said, ‘there is a magnificent castle there to-day.’ As he went in he heard a horn blow, and the $Prince made his way into the castle. 

He saw that all the $Places and the shops in the castle had appeared from the castle, and in many of them a new $Place was standing, near by the castle, where the $Prince had seen the castle and had seen the beautiful palace. And in this garden stood a beautiful apple for him to taste, for he had no child; it was so beautiful that he thought it would never stop growing. 

He went into the garden and looked around, and he found a castle also, and a small castle also, too; but it was all within a month; and by the third month it was full of people, and everything was so full, so rich in flesh and in bones, that he did not think it could be called so beautiful. At the end of the month, as the $Prince ate some good bread and drank some fresh water, however, he found himself standing before one of the great iron gates of the castle; he was forced to run out through the iron gate and let the gate in for him, when a heavy blow knocked him over so hard that he almost went out for the door. He heard the horn of the $Villain, and he heard three giants talk upon the rock, and they said, ‘You have taken from us a very large bird, we will slaughter him and eat him.’ Now they were afraid of the $Prince, and put a $MagicalObject in his ear, and sent him away on a wild goose-coffin; and when he was at home, they left him lying upon the ground in the fields, and they thought he should be quite dead; and they cut off his head, and all his bones and ragged clothes, and hung him up in a tree. 

A great many birds flew by, and saw how he had been carried away, but could not bring him back alive or alive to-day. When the $Villain got into a quarrel with the bird, he was so overcome that he fell down into a deep sleep; he was never able to rise; while the $Prince stood at the foot of a tree, thinking it no longer evil to live by your side; when the two sat down together they laughed and jeered at one another, but not a word ever came of it. When they had been sitting by this they sat down to the song for the third time, when, hearing a hoarse voice, they rose up and cried out: 

‘Lift him up, Loth-hearted Snow-white, Lend us your head, we will kill him!’ 

And the bird, taking hold of his eyes, and seeing him dead, cried out: 

‘Lift up your head, Loth-hearted Snow-white, bring us your head, we will kill him!’ 

The two sat down to discuss this matter; but they never came to an understanding over one another; but when a great flock of the birds came by they said that it was good for them to have an old friend dead, and that they would carry the poor bird to a $Prince who was a great friend to them. 

When the bird heard this, he sprang back from his nest, and was quite well taken care of by his parents. At night, when they first met each other, he said in a friendly way: 

‘My mother gave me some bread and wine.’ 

‘I have also a fine horn for you, $MagicalObject. How can you dislike me?’ said the father. ‘You are not wise, your teeth are dull, and you cannot tell me why I am always angry or angry about something.’ 

Then they all set to work at once to fix the $Prince, and he learnt the tricks of the trade. He learnt how to play a horn when playing at a distance, to flute when playing at flute, and to kiss when kissing; how to chop, how to strike, how to throw up, how to pick, and so

 it." After they were separated by six leagues they went back together into the town; and after they had walked for three or four miles, they came to the entrance of a green wood, through which stood a small $MagicalObject. A white dove perched upon a branch of a tree that stood above it; and in one of the branches a beautiful $MagicalObject was lying; and when a large deer came down and began to dance, the dove caught them in one hand; and they fell into the garden, where a flock of birds began singing together again; and while the birds were singing, a raven flew over the $MagicalObject and said: "Bring the $Helpers hither, or I will catch you." And the bird flew up to the roof and cried: "If you will only listen to me, I will grant you a boon: "Bring the $Helpers hither, or I will take you." And the bird flew into the garden, and cried: "Bring the $Helpers hither, or I will give you a blow." And the bird flew into the garden, and cried: "Bring the $Helpers hither, or I will tear you." The raven flew all about, and cried: "Bring the $Helpers hither, or I will drive you." The bird flew all over the garden, and cried: "Bring the $Helpers hither, or I will eat you." And the bird flew into the garden, and cried: "Bring the $Helpers hither, or I will drive you." The raven flew all round, and cried "Oh dear; what will become of you for ever? Take this horse, this stag, this lamb, and take the $Helpers home again, and carry their bones to church, and show them to your sons, and they will all thank you." 

Now the raven had set his $MagicalObject on the grass; and when the sun rose, and it became dark, he went straight to the fire; then he put another $MagicalObject on it, but it burned bright red before it touched him. And the $Helpers came home together; and they looked down upon them, and they looked sad; and poor dear children they were. And all the birds sang and clapped themselves fast to the $Helpers' feet, and said, "We rejoice with you!" As soon as they had said it they flew down the garden. Then they brought $MagicalObject with them, and showed it to the twelve $Helpers, and they said: "A costly one has the task of proving that we are true servants." And the bird lay down under a tree in the green wood; and the raven came back from the $Helpers; and the bird laid himself down upon his knees before them; and they laid him on his knees and prayed. Then the bird sprang up in a rage, and said: "How can I thank you? I must have forgotten you to-day." And the raven went into the garden and cried: "How can I to-day? I was away at the time to-day, and I have forgotten you to-day by-day." And the bird flew away to the roof and cried: "Where is my roof? Come again." And the roof flew down, and the raven flew up to the roof; and the bird cried: "Where is my $Place?" And the $Helpers, and the birds, and all the animals went home together, and they all thanked the bird for all the trouble they had had in his presence, for they had only begun to think of him once when the raven and the others went to the garden. 

A widow was so sorrowful that she would not leave her children alone, so they put away the little boy, and they went away to the country that goes by many houses. From time to time there came to the house a woman that looked very ugly, for her hair was so long that it clung fast to her chin. "How can I be poor," said she: "if my son shall not be with me to eat, and to be with me to bathe, and to keep him on the couch" 

"If my son shall not be with me to go out to the fields, and to play with my crows as it is called by the crows," said she, "I pray you, wife, leave me. I am so sick of the $MagicalObject. If I am allowed to die by my hands any time, I must leave you, for I would not be able to bear it." So she had a long life. 

One day, as she was going up in the chimney she peeped out and saw a face and a face like the face of a maiden. And she looked up and thought she had seen a maiden in her youth, but she saw in that face nothing but that which was in reality a maiden and a youth.

 ran out to find a man on the road who looked a little different than he was. 

“He was a poor fellow out there,” said the $Villain. “I will find him fast,” and he led the horse to some bushes. The $Prince took the boy to his $Place, took him out of his carriage, and put him down in the carriage, and began to ride as quickly as he could. Then the horse began to gallop, and the rider took note of all the horses passing the spot and ran after it, thinking it was the right spot. 

He found a beautiful carriage, which the $Prince came and set out to see. But the horse was so small that the $Prince could not keep him close enough to see it. He took it up and had an inquiring look at it, as it appeared quite small and very plain. His heart went out to it, but the good things he had to do kept him going. It was a poor thing to pass by that was full of poverty, and the great people who were at the table were also well off. 

He got up the horse and found the carriage was quite empty. A good many people had left the $Villain and were coming to look for him, but he had found them all. He soon found out to whom the $Prince owed all his wealth, and that he owed his success to the care of a shepherd, who took care of him. He also made the shepherd do all the cooking and everything with the $Prince. 

He now turned to the shepherd, but the $Prince was content without him. The shepherd, however, did not like the old woman, and wanted to make her a cook. He wanted to have the new one as well, but the young man wanted her to be a tailor. 

He made out very well that the young man was a fine fellow and a very kind fellow. He would eat meat that he liked and was well versed in sewing and how to make it. He had a large collection of fine things he wanted to show to the $Prince. He wanted to show that he also had great knowledge and could manage some things with the $Prince. On this the young man had a great deal of wisdom in different kinds of magic implements, and when he told the $Prince all about them he received lots of love. The shepherd was much in favour of him. 

The $Prince was very satisfied with his dinner. The great table was made of white and blue silk, and he had a large plate of cakes and biscuits and a large glass of wine. He went to bed to sleep, but soon found himself dreaming. He thought he saw the $Prince and how he rose up to serve him. He thought that all the good things that people had said about him came true, and he could not think of anything else to do. 

A baker got into a quarrel with a $Villain, and he was to cut his bread in two and set the table before them. Every one was to do this, which was to be a fine thing for the poor and wonderful. The old woman was a very simple-hearted one; she could not help thinking that all the good things happened behind the scenes. She had heard of many good things happening in the Kingdom behind the scenes, and she thought the poor peasants who had been sold into death might be helped. 

She set up a large table. There was plenty of food and drink and plenty of wine. Every one was to do everything he could. He should put on his shirt and put on his shoes and put on his boots. He should lie down at home in his bed in comfortable lighted rooms. Everything should be well before the evening. The $Princes should be at the table, with their food and drink, their good clothes and the tablecloth. 

They should try and make merry before they became hungry, which was to be a very good thing. He should take his shirt off, put on his shirt and shoes, lay down in his bed in their soft lighted rooms, and have a good meal. He should get his shirt and shoes on and he should be well taken care of. The $Princes should be allowed to go into their lands and go to great feasts. 

The $Prince was to make use of all the treasures his heart had and get everything ready for his next feasting. This feast he had prepared himself with many good things. He had a large and beautiful large bowl of porridge; he had a large book of all kinds of books; and he liked to eat bread and butter too. He loved to eat with his brothers and sisters at the feast. 

The poor peasants were to come down, and if anyone came in he should be killed. The murderers must also get up there and wait for them. One of the young men who had looked after

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 into this world, she was a wonderful girl; a young, brilliant and beautiful maiden; and when all went well, she was very happy and thoughtful, and was always giving off an air of being a clever little girl. 

'I was delighted to be called so, it seemed,' she said; 'but it was wonderful how it came off, and how little I was.' She got up her hand and saw the little needle; the little cudgel in her hand! It seemed soft to her. 

'Well?' she said; and she did, indeed, understand her mother to be the lovely little girl I knew, though I was not really her in the beginning, for $Place was so much like the world beyond her, 'I was so sad when she was crying!' 

'Tut, tut! I was so sad! It was like weeping when you are only a minute in my life.' 

'I was so sad!' 

'I'm so glad!' 

'I felt so happy!' 

'It was so wonderful being so glad! It was like to be an old fairy again in my little world! When you have such a good life, there's less of a need to worry about worrying about something!' 

'The future is too soon!' 

'Of course it's too soon,' said Anne, as she reached her seat. 

She had a very long and proud walk for a mother, which is a very high kind of walking. Anne lives in a castle at sea, but she was in the county of Wales, where the trees were a great many years old. 

'I have to confess, you're the most curious one to meet mothers, especially when you're a young woman; and I couldn't be more curious.' 

'But it's only a mere child!' 

'Yes, that's a different matter. I must confess, it's just really the first year! I'm quite ashamed that the money was at all useful to me at any rate.' 

'Ah! you have a good head, Anne.' 

'I wish we hadn't made any more money,' said Anne, with a great deal of emphasis on that little child that was sitting outside of her. 

'I do,' said Anne, 'and I do!' And she went on for quite a great stretch as if on an endless rambling. 'Why, if there's any money at all, it's only because I've taken advantage of a mortgage I have so far earned money.' 

'Why, no, I never were,' said Anne, who was smiling a little. 'I'm proud of it. I'm proud that I've made money!' 

'Oh, I can't be happier! Besides; you were one of the happiest I ever was! I'm sure it was because I was happier. I was too happy. It was a lucky thing to have all these wonderful young people in the world!' 

'It wasn't the happiest, wasn't it? But I suppose no one was happier than people who had money. Why did it come at all!' 

'Not the happiest people! I have a few of them which have been fortunate people. But I felt as though they were. It wasn't happiness at all. It was only a feeling of belonging. I suppose they were happier just because they had a good home, but even then in life they don't have to live as happy people.' 

'I've never been happier!' 

'Oh, indeed!' And she went on for a very long stretch to answer Anne's question with something almost wonderful as if it were a question of fate, 'I just think there's something curious about it. I thought I'd have a little bit of fun. I suppose the more I think about it, even if I haven't quite been happy the more I just like being an ordinary little girl.' 

'Ah!' 

'You'd best get back to her, I've thought over it!' 

After a good while came the little cudgel. Anne leaned against the door, and took the small needle in her hand. She made out one small part of the story about Anne's mother; and as she dropped it on the floor, the girl came in, with a big, shiny eye, and stood ready to run away with the needle. Anne drew back her elbow from the window, and looked up in the face of the little cudgel, but the boy was just as silent as when she had been talking. 

'It didn't hurt me at all!' 

'How did you like it? I've always been curious,' said the cudgel in the doorway. 

'You don't understand,' said Anne, 'I always

But the bird was gone; and the man’s wife could not go out again, so he went through a hole in a wall and dug his way through a little hole into the wall. ‘Oh’s that a good thing to do,’ said he; ‘I can go inside myself while the clock sounds, and then I can rest without turning it, for they always say to rest when two birds are perched on each other’s ears.’ So the wife entered the room, and as she did not hear the man’s voice, she got in and sat next to him. When they were seated there, she said, ‘Lord, are these I want?’ And the lord said, ‘No, not at all.’ Then he began to grope his way through, but he was able to get out as fast as he could, and without much difficulty, set his shoes on the floor. The wife got down upon the floor to look at the shoes, and when she looked up she saw three feet of fresh shoe-shovel on the floor. ‘Such a marvel,’ said the lord, ‘how many toes the wife can get off!’ ‘Never fear,’ said the wife. ‘I know what I shall eventually find out;’ said the lord, ‘go easy, and when you see the shoes lying down, you shall be certain to find them all.’ Then he went down and laid himself down by the feet of the wife; but as the shoes were still lying on the floor, the lord said, ‘Let us now play a trick.’ But the wife said, ‘Let us play the trick a second time,’ and the lord ran over to the stool and put on the shoes. Then the wife got up and played them, and she was so much pleased with the result, that she put them on again, and played them at once. 

And all the time she looked at the shoes her feet were always on the ground, and the two feet had never changed shape. At last it was a long time since she had played any part in the game, and all things turned into one; so she said to herself, ‘Oh, what am I to do? What am I to wear on my feet when I go in and out of rooms?’ Then all became quiet and the two women left her alone. The old woman thought she might as well shut herself in an empty little chamber; so she set out for home, and the two young men followed her wherever she went and they found no one to put her on the spot. Once when she was playing with the three brothers, they were playing together and looking at the three toes of the wife. ‘Oh,’ said she, ‘what a charming fellow I shall be! I shall soon be back again! Good-bye!’ and they bowed low to her and she trotted away. 

While she was still within reach, a bird flew by and sang: ‘Let no one speak to-day, except those who are $MagicalObject of the house of Thumb,’ and the old woman said, ‘I hear the voice of the birds within the room.’ On hearing this, the birds became more rosy blue; so she took leave of them, and when she came to the chamber where Thumb was, she said to herself, ‘I shall soon be back again! Good-bye!’ and she flew back again to the old woman’s chamber, and then she crept slowly and softly inside to see how the bird was singing. No sooner did she put her hand into her pocket than the bird came chirping once more and pecked at her eye, and said, ‘Who should I help with my ears?’ ‘None at all,’ replied the woman, ‘but you, who are the $MagicalObject of the house of Thumb.’ Then the bird did as the woman wished, pecked at her ear, and said, ‘Thy ears, I hope, is nothing but my own.’ But the woman looked inside, and saw that the bird had become still more rosy and blue. ‘Here, then, do not despair, my dear birds, we will soon rid ourselves of the $MagicalObject.’ Then her heart became very hearty and she put out her hand, and a little while later Thumb came flying, and stood still and sang: ‘Let no one speak to-day, except those who are $MagicalObject of the house of Thumb, and this song shall remain with thee until I return.’ Then, as Thumb was about to sing something sounded in the bird’s ear; and this is

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
she had been out for a good while, and had been looking forward to going to dinner with her mother. When the mother said nothing, she said it so well in fact that she could not help looking at it; only she could find it so funny that she should say it so proudly, and she said she would take a little apple from the shelf. 

The $Prince, who was a good-hearted man, and had not thought of spoiling the apple, said, “What a pity such a fine apple as that is, when you can go into the palace and see a very handsome and charming lady. It is not worth while to eat a piece, for you are so nice and sweet.” 

The $Prince, as his mother said, looked at it so fondly as to be sorry. However, she thought she had never seen such a beautiful apple in her whole life. Then he laughed, and said, “Don't you know, the good things of this world are so great, that when it comes to me, these are not so small.” So he thought, “All of a sudden, the apples themselves become so wonderful and so precious, that I should be quite glad.” When the day came however, he went home and said to himself, “Why in the world then should I want to eat a piece?” 

All at once he got home and asked his mother, “Why should I want to die?” She replied, “When we are so young, we will not want to die.” 

So her beautiful daughter was put to bed very quickly, and it was as if the wind blew her away. Then the two peas in the sack got a spring-cover in the shape of a rose, and by the evening the peas were ready, and a $Villain, with great pomp and ceremony, came and plumped up into a carriage and drove to the $Prince and the three girls and thanked them. 

At last there was a fine meal prepared, and the $Prince went to the dining-hall, where there were three hundred and fifty chairs. Now this meal was of course very expensive. His mother and sisters were very happy because of the grandeur of the table. But in reality it was much better; the rich and the people were much more humble and pleasant. 

So the $Villain was once again obliged to sit down and watch the whole company; and as he was looking down he thought that he heard a little voice cry out from above “Come to bed, my lady!” and fell down in bed and awoke. The $Villain was standing up from the bed and stood up, too afraid to try anything. So he tried his hand in some old suit of armour, but her face was so grim, and she had no hair in her head. “I have thought of some way to keep myself warm,” said he, and began to pull on her hair, but she had to stoop down to do it, and the man drew his knife out of his belt and took a knife which was so heavy and white that she could not even draw it out. Then on the next morning the $Prince was ordered to come to the table to see what was done, and he begged and he and his lady sat down at this very same table. But the $Villain was not fond of waiting, and she begged and she and her lady began to beat him together, and he was so angry that it was quite a shock when he heard the others interrupt themselves in thinking that there might be something to it, and so he took his knife and sliced off their heads, and cut off their foreheads, and put them in two coffins. There lay the $Villain with the $Prince, and he saw his bride come to him and to his sister that the other had been slain, and that with the $Prince and the $Villain dead, his niece was left standing. 

Poor but pretty $Prince lay dead among the bodies. But poor little $Prince soon got up and wanted to say the words about the old man, but he would not utter them, and he begged and prayed to be let out, and still he begged and prayed, and still he wept and begged for mercy out of the $Villain, but she did not answer no one but said: 

“You are a lovely $Villain, a noble and worthy lady, the daughter of a $Villain, in truth that is no kind of man. I was once your servant $Villain, and since you have loved me so very much, I ask you, do you go away and tell my lady, who is my dear daughter, that I am my true $Villain.” 

When she heard that her little $Hero was left in a very terrible straitened life

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
, 'Well, he has made this big and old man,' says the cook. 'And he was never in the best shape before.' 

'What?’ says Michael. 

'Well, man, I guess I ought to be thanking heavens for you. I never heard of old Stemp.' 

'That sounds old,' says $Hero. 

'Of old,' says $Hero; 'I suppose you can't tell him.' 

The cook goes away. Michael's eyes move. He is not sure what the end of this letter should be. He looks at $Hero. 

'Are you coming?' says the cook, turning his back again. 

'Yes, $Hero,' says $Hero.'Are you coming for dinner? If you have, come here.' 

There is so much silence that $Hero doesn't know what to say. 

'I know I shall get a little light in,' she says. 'I shall get a little fire. And I shall see my mother and sister going to bed.' 

$Hero sits and looks on the kitchen floor. $Donor takes the cup from the stove and brings it up the ladder at the back of the stove and the little ladder up from the floor. The cook goes downstairs and stands at the door. 

'You have a kind $Helper, $Hero,' says the cook, addressing him through the window. 

$Hero is very happy and looks anxiously over the threshold, to see if anything is not already there. $Villains and $Helper begin to dance and dance about that window. Michael looks at the clock, then rises to go and put the money there; but $Hero just rises and puts the money into the clock. 

The time flies on by like a pendulum on fire. $Hero is very happy, now, not at the sight of the money, but at that in the moment at which they danced; in her excitement she had never danced so loudly or so fast. 

A woman comes from afar into $Place, who comes at once and orders $Hero to come. Meanwhile $Hero takes it very well with her elbow, and the dance comes to an end. She is very happy and turns to look out the window. At home $Hero is not so well ordered that the cook says no more dancing. She goes to bed, she lies down again, takes the old wooden plank down $Place, and puts it up again. She looks into $Place and sees that it is not the old frame or the little chair, but the little table, that is there but the old frame. 

$Hero looks into $Place, and sees that it is one of the benches now. $Donor, thinking she has heard some noise, sends her to the same end of the row, which is just now, and there the old chair is again. When she comes to the kitchen, she looks all over again. It is all on glass, and the old frame is on the old iron stand still. She thinks she has found the little table, but it is not the table at all. 

In the kitchen a great long long wait the cook has not made, and then $Hero sits in it. Her heart is very heavy for it was an open chest at the beginning, but she is glad for it she is so far away that it does not cost her anything. 

It is just before eight o'clock, when she comes out of the door. In that hour $Hero goes to sleep and $Donor comes. In the moment they stop dancing; but it was only in the moment that they danced. You can see this dance is very great by the window, and it is wonderful that $Hero could see it, how many arms she could draw. 

$Donor takes the little cloth from the cupboard, and is very pretty and lovely. Then $Hero was a little girl. She had a great deal of pretty things in her, a ball, a sword, a spoon, a ring, and the cloth of every sort, and she had a broom, but there was nothing to get upon her. To make herself more useful, she did not like to take anything. And that she thought most prettily, and could do even better, was in putting her clothes in the pots, or in making her stand in one room, but she did none of this. The dishes were all clean, and it was the same. And now we begin the dance! She is now $Donor, the great, beautiful, kind, pretty, and childlike figure. 

The kitchen now begins. It is like the beginning of a long dance, it is wonderful. And it is the same with $Hero. The dance goes on as long as you will ever be able: at the end we have a great dance.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========

You are a real good-for-nothing, your mother says, and you have a very odd kind of way with which to insult someone; and that's why I'm so sure you have such a hard-to-control appetite, so keen-for-lays talk and such a big eye and such a fierce edge. But I'm too real and too real for that, for none of these things could ever really save my mother. She was just that sort of girl, but she was just a child-like thing! And she was the kind of girl who was kind of frightened or depressed or frightened or depressed herself, and as such she liked to speak to strangers about their fears. 

They were now very late in arriving at her house, and they would lie there and listen to her; but as for herself, she did her best to be as cheerful as she could, with some sort of gentle encouragement. 

There was no more to be said. It was then, that she found herself listening to the conversation itself. 

'Where are you going?' she thought and then looked out, her eyes locked on the door; and her voice choked with fear. 'Where are you going?' 

'I'm going back to the $Place I came from, and I haven't been back since I was eight years old.' 

'What, you're mad?' 

'Mad! Mad! I thought the old woman had run off,' said Lily, now, to herself again. 'But I couldn't look away, for I didn't want her to, for I was so frightened and so awful mad at her. She is so happy, and I am so sure she has an eye for human faces. You can make those eyes seem real and innocent. What makes you happy?' 

'I've had people say,' said $Helper, then 'you can make those eyes seem like real eyes to you,' and she nodded. 'They look like real eyes.' 

'And they don't look at me,' said $MagicalObject. 

'No,' said Lily, and she turned towards the window, but before she could look it was off again, but not out of the corner of her eye. 'Well, we'll have to drive out the last drop of rain; and I think I shall put on gloves and make sure you don't see me.' 

'Don't!' $Donor said. 'I'll think about it, I know better.' 

'I think. If we stay, I shall leave you for ever. You are so kind and gentle. They must have liked you better when you came, but now it's not you in that, it is their eyes with which I'm afraid to speak. If you stay, I shall have to go back to the very beginning.' 

'Very well; but then I'll think of a way out,' said the $Helper; and she took a hand to $MagicalObject's eyes. 

'But you mustn't go out yet, you see,' said the other, so he didn't look out of the corner of his eye. 

'Yes, I must. My mother's keeping everything to me, now, so you'd give a bad feeling if I went out. But don't leave me,' said $Donor, looking at the sky and at the $Place she was going with her eyes and hands, 'for I won't be safe from the rain. It will make a terrible storm.' 

'Don't worry,' said the $Helper, 'or I'll give you back your coat, and your boots, and your hat, and your scarf. But I am safe.' 

'Yes,' said $MagicalObject, 'but I'm sure it may make your mother look awful. I'm quite sure she will say you're a girl when you go out with her. But I think my mother's an oaf. I think I'll be sorry to lose you,' and she turned again. 

She had been looking at the sky with eyes that looked at the ground with eyes that didn't. Her heart was going up and down again, and her legs were dragging down the floor. 

'Come on,' said $MagicalObject, still holding up her hand to $Donor, 'we'll get to the house of a friend before things get too chilly.' 

'You will go with $Helper,' said $Helper, 'and $Helper mustn't go without.' 

$MagicalObject took the great hand to $Donor, who was looking at her in surprise. 

'You're going with $Helper? I haven't told you that, if I hadn't asked you at first, you'd never have had much of a chance.' 

'I'm no different

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 into my eyes and my bones. I looked down into the little hole there were three little drops, and the second one was right across the floor in the middle. There was a light there from the window. And when the old woman had gone, I thought, as quickly as possible. But it was just like other old $Helpers, and it was just as if they had never worked in the world. I looked all round the room, and every day I dreamed that I was there, but I couldn't see anybody. The only thing I knew was that there were three drops underneath the ground. The other two were on my bones, and one of them just dropped out of my nose with a little tremor. And there they were. One time I thought, when I thought I was about to lay down and rest again, I thought I'd go down the stone steps, and if I didn't get up at some later hour, if I never touched one of the old $Helpers again, then what would be left for me?I was so terribly frightened with fear. When I thought I'd go down in a stone hole, I looked down into the little hole and stood up in a great hurry. The stone doors on the first and second floor were all of the old $Helpers' own design, and everything was already so very different and really quite strange. It was so beautiful and it was so splendid, but all at once things went terribly, terribly wrong. There were three big holes, with little rakes and wooden dowels and things on them. I had to go down the steps and sit down at one of them, and on the third time I had to sit down again right next to the old woman. Then I thought, I must go down into these old holes and get something to eat, and it was just as if someone had tried to make them for me. And that was when I was quite frightened because I went down right down into the first old $Helpers' hole. There were three little drops below right beside that, and they were right on my bones. Then I thought, I might go up to them and see if I could break them, but I couldn't. And all at once my bones went right down into the old $Helpers' hole. Once again I thought there wouldn't be any more room any more, it must be a trap. The door was still open and I could feel the stone beneath me go through it. After I had had that over again, the door went out the other way, and I went up to the old woman and whispered, 'I'm sure that there won't be any more room in that room, you will see.' And then she said, 'I'll throw the coffin over you if you won't.' Not satisfied with that, and not being at peace any longer, I threw the coffin over him and thought, I must go down another long way too, and I couldn't find a way out of there. Well, I didn't so long as thought it was a nice little space, and I tossed the coffin back at the old woman who was so excited that she didn't dare to come back. When I came to the bottom of the hole, I saw that all three little drops had already been broken, and there was nothing else left to do but to sit there, and all at once the stone door flew open. I went down and sat down on a stone bench to wait, and one half of the stone was crushed, while the other half I threw out and thought we had made a good crack, if not we should have got it straight out from under the coffin. And while I wanted to wait a bit longer before coming back down again, and as it was very hard to get the stone out, I couldn't think of a way out of the hole, and I just rolled down the stone bench. A few more days passed and then a man came along in my pocket and said, 'Now I am going to build a house as good as it can be. The first thing I want to do is to have a tailor and a tailor-engineer come and cut your clothes.' I was very grateful and made a large amount of money in my own pocket, and they all agreed to go and see me how they could make a splendid house. During the winter when I was away, the weather in Switzerland was really cold so thick that I had to leave off. However, the little hole had become somewhat hot and, indeed, a fire was standing there, and when the first couple of nights passed I sat down on it and slept just like any other person. The next night I sat down again, and they worked hard for the next day and night and when the weather should have continued to be very nice it was, indeed, cold, because the earth beneath it burned very hot. Finally, on the third night I thought there'd be no need to go any further because I could have got into the house as soon as

, but it was so thin, so soft that no one could see the hair grow. 

It was beautiful, when one was small enough, and there were so many little beauties in it. One was so delicate and delicate, that one was afraid of her. 

'The beautiful thing is she's still small enough to go out for a walk with me,' she said to herself, and was as gentle and kind as one might be in infancy. 'I haven't noticed her since she became too big.' 

All this was to take $Hero out of her mind again, for she loved little things, and nothing was bigger than one of her little little things; and when little things are small and delightful, it is so delightful that one is glad and glad. It is a lovely spring! 

And when she came home and said to herself: 

'Is this the way everything has gone back to me?' 

'Yes!' she exclaimed. 'It's just like when one's heart is in its right hand, and one can be happy.' 

And now she was quite happy again. She began to talk to herself, and she thought to herself: 

'Would it please $Hero just to say good-night?' $Hero couldn't take her heart out of her, and she lay down with her arms round her, with something to go on. 

'Goodnight, $Hero,' she said. And she lay down again, with something to go on. 

'Good-night, $Hero,' she said. And she lay down with her arms around her again. 

'Good-night, $Hero,' she said. And she lay down again with her arms round her. 

Sometimes she had to go to bed very early and then she was quite tired. She put on her little coat, and lay down behind the piano, and the piano slowly began to play with her little feet. 

'Morning, $Hero, and good evening!' $Hero called to herself as she heard, for there was something that sounded as if it was coming nearer. 'Good morning, $Hero!' 

$Hero felt quite sleepy, but the sound was very wonderful. 'Good evening, $Hero!' she said as she heard a little voice. 'Good evening, $Hero!' she said. 'Good evening, $Hero.'" $Hero was quite aware of this, but she had no doubt that they were still in bed. 

$Hero stretched out her little hand to push it to the box. The little hand made such a strong push that the box was nearly full. 'Good afternoon to you, $Hero, and good morning, $Hero.' 

'Good morning, $Hero, and good afternoon,' said $Hero with a few quick steps toward the door. 'Good afternoon to you, $Hero, and good morning, $Hero.' 

'Good morning, $Hero, and good afternoon,' said $Hero, and the door opened with a crash. They went in, but they didn't go out of the garden, for there were no trees lying under the shrubbery. It was like a little forest, with wild beasts and wild beasts, for it was quite wild; and the only way to escape the wild beasts was to go outside and kill them. $Hero had to climb down into the shrubbery; but as she went inside, and it was quite dark outside, she was not safe until everything was dark inside and the fire was on the stove and it was time for the candle to warm up. 

'$Hero, my child,' she whispered. 'Why do you shiver so much? Do you cry? Do you think about everything?' 

$Hero shook her head sadly. She had never known anything as bad as this; but now she knew. She had not felt anything so awful as when she had come to the dark outside, and she went in, and when she came upstairs into the house there were still so much light, and no ragged clothes. The two of them lived at home with their father, and their room was warm, and if they had eaten once before, they probably hadn't been hungry now, but they had grown very hungry and did not now have any of the good things in their house. 

$Hero and $Hero lay down and kissed each other, and $Hero went to bed and slept soundly. Then the next morning a little boy came and said, "$Hero I know who you are, and that is $Hero: yet there is $MagicalObject in your bag." And $Hero ran to the little boy and said, "$Hero I must go to the garden, and gather the nuts, then I can pass over there." 

'But you never came!' came the little boy's reply. 'You must have been in

 the $Helper, ‘I have come to seek you in my dreams, and yet you have never been here.’ Then the $Helper said, ‘If you will grant it I will make you wait in your dreams for a great deal longer.’ Then he took his way, and he came to a spring where he saw a beautiful maiden lying asleep on a straw. The $Helper and $Hero rode round her and saw the maiden climb up on some straw. Then she cried out: ‘Oh, $Hero, why have I fallen asleep just now?’ The $Hero knew her and said, ‘O $Hero, you see me quite well. I wanted, however, to take you away from here; now, I will give you the biggest straw in the town. Cut through all the straw, and you will find yourself in a room just as beautiful as before, and you shall be more happy.’ The $Helper and $Hero thought to themselves, “Ah, my good lord, how happy I am!” And they laid their heads beneath her legs, and when she had lifted her head she said, ‘I thank you very much.’ Then she said, ‘O $Hero, you must give me back $Places, or I shall never get any.’ The $Helper and $Hero laid hold of her by her side and let her go. Then they took her into their arms and tied her up. It was so beautiful that the $Villain’s son wanted nothing to do with it, but thought of his old friend. Then they took her to the $Villain, who was glad to see them again and had her tied up. They soon saw the straw was gone, and they set out to build a great city. The walls and all the top of the walls were covered with the most beautiful gold. Every part of the city was surrounded with silver and gold. At night the castle at the foot of the mountain rose above the ground. A cat stood at the top of the castle, roamed about and ate the $Villain’s daughter; and her hair stood on end above the earth. When she went up to the top she was wearing a white gown, and on the bottom of the gown was a crown, which she carried on her back with both hands. The $Villain also was dressed in gold and silver and he had three chambers in the castle, where $MagicalObject were stored, and everything that belonged to one of these rooms could be bought for gold. The $Hero and the $Heroine and all the people who came to see them welcomed them. They made all their wishes, and were very happy. Then they thought to themselves, ‘The $Villain loves us so much that he has given us to have fun and to watch the $Villain.’ Then they had fun again, and on the third day when they had to go out again, they wanted to catch a train. When they went into the town, however, the $Villain had already given away all his lands. So they bought themselves one carriage after another. And the $Villain thought, ‘I can go to the castle, and I will show them where the castle ends and where everything begins, so that nobody will think that we are here yet.’ So he sent the $Villain and the people who came riding with him on horseback, and they followed the $Villain and began their journey. When the train stopped at the Castle of the $Villain, everybody became merry and ran about. Then the $Villain and his people went into the forest and began to hunt. After long they met one of the $Villains who was quite sad and said to him ‘What misfortune has come to us! There is a great beast’s beak and tail standing about and are out hunting.’ ‘Let us stay with you until at least midnight, or we shall devour you whole.’ Said the $Villain, ‘That is not allowed, you must wait until after dark.’ Then everybody sat up in their chairs and waited until midnight, and when the train arrived at the castle, everyone was so sad that they ran out to the forest. And then the $Villain and his people said to each other, ‘In the meantime walk on and enjoy yourselves with our guests until we come back at full speed again.’ When the train had reached the Castle of the $Villain, everyone rejoiced greatly, and when they came to the Castle of the $Villain, everyone rejoiced greatly. So they set out, and at the far end of the forest sat a $Helper, whose name was $MagicalObject. When she saw the $Helper she became afraid. Nevertheless, she crept slowly down the forest side until she came into a brook and shut herself in. When the train arrived at her

“and that $Hero had never asked my opinion before. The others in the court-yard laughed and jeered at my telling them, “Well, we do know.” “All right.” $Hero and his companions had gone out into the desert, where they had not been able to find the key. At sunset, however, they came upon a huge, dark room, and one of the three companions climbed down into the room and retrieved the key from it. When they looked for the key in the darkness for more than an hour, they found it was in a glass case. $Hero had been in the desert long enough, of course. But he had not been there that evening yet, and he would not have slept until he had found them. So he was still awake when he went to sleep. Once he began to dream in dreams, and these he continued to dream about, until at some point he woke up, and he had been dreaming in dreams for such a long time that he was thinking about the same things, and he thought of the door. “What a good boy I am.” he said to himself. “I must also tell you something. Tonight I was very tired and had to go to bed. Tonight I saw a gold plate on the wall. I thought,” he said again, “It was a key.” “Wait,” cried the other two companions, “take it away from my friend.” “That would be a terrible mistake for $Hero,” said one of them. “There is no such key,” they went on, speaking harshly, “that makes you and mine. I can give you the key!” Once again their companions kept on saying that this was a terrible mistake, and finally “I think I shall have to tell you the news,” and they went on. “I found the key in the night, and now what do I have to do?” They searched in every direction and found several hundred gold plates, and they were on their feet and ready to go out and find them. “This is a lucky thing,” said the $Helper, “because it is the key, and no one can have it.” They ran after them, and in the evening the old fairy came, and she helped them to get the key again. The $Helper took it from his lap, and when the young $Helper came, he was so happy that he couldn’t resist it. “Good-night!” he said to the dear, young girl, and she let him go. 

Once on a time there lived in a village a man and a woman and their dog sat together. At the end of one day they went outside and listened to the barking of the dogs. Then they went to a pond and stood close to it. The dog was always barking and the man always grunting. “It must be a poor little cottage,” he said. “We must hide in it, or it is going to be disturbed!” But the dog’s master did not care, but let him go, and their dog soon came in through the kitchen door. “Ah, my little man,” cried he petted and scratched the fur of the dog. “When daylight comes, I will go inside and put on my coat, otherwise the dog may run away with us.” “No, indeed!” said the old man, but he did it in a frightened voice, as if the dog had run away and frightened him. “The dog may be coming to disturb us.” However, he did not run away but merely pushed the fur off him and let him go. “Well, then, we won’t have to worry about it,” thought the dog, as he got the fur back from the fur-curdling gentleman in the kitchen. This was how they ran. When the man got out from under the sofa, he was so frightened that he said, “Wait, can you have my dog?” But the dog refused to come any longer, and he was caught from behind by the couch and held prisoner. “When daylight comes,” said the man, “I will go inside to see what my master has got looking at me, and when he has recovered himself, I will come out and fetch my master.” Upon saying this, they both went inside. Then the man called the wife, whose face was so ugly that she could hardly speak. The dog was already at their feet and had snatched up the fur-curdling gentleman by the hair, but she held him tightly and whispered: “I cannot let him live such a miserable life.” They went to the cottage and knocked at the door.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
Hero and his three brothers, who had gone with their mother and father to the $Place where they had been taken before their minds. 

Now I must leave the matter to a little daughter, who could not possibly understand what it all meant. She was a girl, I am afraid, with all her fine colors and all her wonderful manners and her sweet and friendly manners; so, if she could, I should like to think she might try the idea; but I will not. 

The day of the meeting ended. The little girl was sitting on a little casket. Her mouth was shut. 

'Here!' she said. 'Put your hands and feet close around me, and let me go.'  'You seem so young, isn't it?' she asked more politely. 

'Yes,' I answered, but she did not understand her. 

'Well, my mother will let me go; then I shall tell you about my father,' she said, 'and if he will be so kind as you are, you shall have the $Helper's ring and be $Donor of the world.' 

Now my mother said she would not tell my father, because he had not yet come back to the town from the wood where he had left us. But I had told her all I could of my little sister. I told my father, too, but he was afraid. 

The little girl went into the house. She stopped in the yard and dropped her basket of flowers on the grass before I saw. 

'Oh, mother of me that am am am. My stepdaughter isn't far away from my house by her house, mother. She said the $Helper would be so sweet and gentle and friendly as to come and fetch you.' she said sadly. 

'Yes? I should like to be so very sweet!' said my father kindly. 

She went up to my mother. She had no more flowers on her white rose and on her lilac, and no more of my tiny little curls, that fell down from her tiny little skirts, the bright and shining white of their lace at the time she told her story. 

But her mother was a pretty lady to the girl who had just told her a story. 

'So now you must come off.' 

'You must. I don’t like it. And you mustn’t forget what I have told you about my father, about your stepmother, about $Donor.' 

'The $Helper, indeed,' said my mother. 

My father had come to his wife’s bedside the following morning. He had not slept since he had begun to feel faint, the light in his eyes still reflected the dark cloudless night. 

My mother was a great woman, the most thoughtful and beautiful she had ever seen; and my father did not even care one moment what my little sister was thinking, for he knew the reason. For her part, she was just waiting for his big heart to begin to come to rest, for her to feel the pleasure of his taking her with one hand and the gladness of his little sister with the other; for when she had had such a joy to attend to, she knew from her sweet voice that he had got her with one hand, and that was that for her. 

She saw to her big heart, for she had always had one, with the other, a little casket with gold in it, hanging on a wall above her kitchen. 

The little girl's heart grew larger with every new thought of leaving the town with the wood, and of going back to the wood to find her father. She felt, she thought, at once, a chance of happiness, of happiness in all its splendor and splendor. She set out from the wood she found a yard of flowers and flowers with all the splendor of the street. But her heart grew heavy with fear as she gazed on the flowers. Only one flower was still remaining that she could not find. I am sure she knew from her sweet voice that her father had been gone five months, and had left the wood for a little while only because people were busy making up their minds that he couldn’t come back again. She did not know how many times she had seen him before his face, for his face only bore the trace of an unhappy feeling. I shall never forget such a face! She looked at the other flowers with a deep, careful eye that seemed to say, "You must look carefully after these," and then turned her eyes to the second flower that lay next to her. 

I cannot imagine the tears that streamed down my face as I looked at the beautiful flowers. I could not take my eyes off that flower as if I were going to die, so I made my way off from the town again. My

, or she might have been poisoned.’ When Fortune had rested, she went away and sat down in her chamber, and in the winter she took a little knife, and cut off her finger with it the goose that was sitting at home, and set it on a tree, and the goose went and picked the goose. And when she looked about, it was as green as snow, and as blue as the sky. Now they came to a garden, and the tree made the path straight ahead of the path, and the goose ran behind it, and cut off the finger, and when she could not perform the feat she went home, tore off the finger, and set it on a tree, and the tree picked it right away and caught the finger. But when she looked at it now, she saw the goose sitting at home, and had no finger left at home, and thought it would be a great kindness to set the goose first, and the goose last, and took the good time to chop off the finger, but the young lady took the good time to tear up the image of the bird, and set the image together with that of the bird upon a small straw in her chamber, and in the spring one of the leaves was so sharp, and the little fellow could hear the sound of it, and could hear what the young lady sang, and she knew that she was to catch the bird that had flown about, and set up with it the image of the little bird upon the straw. And the image fell on the young lady’s finger. Now she began to weep and said, ‘Little bird, bird, why are you so weeping?’ But the bird answered, ‘I am in the garden, and come and bathe in the well of the well.’ Then she went out, took the bird away, and was away, but the young lady could not catch it. Then the young lady set her mouth down among the well, and there she plucked a fly and cut it off. Then she stretched out her hand again, and said, ‘What is that little bird doing?’ but it did not answer. Then she put on her little white hat and crept out of the well and ran after the bird in the well, and let it fall out. The young lady lifted it up, and the bird was gone, and there stood before her the young lady, and there were the two young sisters standing by her and singing to each other. ‘What a sight!’ said she, ‘and what a relief it is to see them all together, singing.’ They took pity on her and made her go away. After a while they came to a house, and one of them was going to fetch water, the other a stove, and each took a piece of bread and put it in the pot. Then the first took a piece of broccadero, the second a crock of buttercup, the third a salad of breadcrumbs and put them into the pot, and the youngest brother took two slates, and sat down in one of the slates and was going to set the bread and spread it on a piece of bread as though it were a small piece of dough. The youngest brother took the slates and passed the meal through to each; then he thought it would be a good thing to leave them behind, and said, ‘Let each take his piece.’ And when all were sat down in the pot, the little sister took the first piece, and was going to fill the slat with bread, but the youngest brother put the second, and then another slice was to be spread on the top of the pot. So the little girl sat down, cut a loaf, and put it on the ground and went to the pot; and as soon as a piece of butter came into the pan, she spread it over the bottom half, and the youngest brother put the third, and went to the pot again. But as well as he had done as long as the youngest brother could set him free, they all went together into the pot and ate. When the pot became quiet, the little sister took her slates, went to the pot, and set the butter on a piece of bread for each, and put one in each hand, and the other on the stove. When all were done, and the pot was silent, the youngest brother took his piece of bread, put it into the pot, and spread the bread all about, and then he stood up. He was much tired out, put out his hand, and said, ‘The young lady may have done a good as she pleased, so give me the slat as well as the poor bird.’ But the bird answered him, ‘I have done a good deed, but it would be dishonourable for me if I did not serve her faithfully.’ Then he took his piece of bread and ate in great glee: but

 bank he did not want to let anything go to the ground, but said that no one dared to hurt him in the palace. 

Then there was also a very kind, kind gentleman who had been sent to fetch milk at the office, but was now frightened by a little cream-cake he had left there. He did not dare to go to the milk station, which was just opposite, and said he was afraid some one had eaten it up, and had only to leave the office to return at the right time. So on and on he went begging for milk at the office, and could not find time to keep working. He was very impatient and thought of going to dinner, when a servant came to help him out. He wanted to drink the milk, but could not find a way to get it for him, so he cut off his hand. 

Thus he was again kept prisoner, and he was held in a solitary cell for seven years for the same mischance. $Helper did not know whether in the secret prison that was supposed to keep him still there he had escaped from $Helper. 

Once more the lady of the castle went to sleep. The castle-door opened and another guest who didn't get his way appeared. He was very distressed, and he cried out to his guests to go to the door. But he had not been told where to go. 

Then he called out and warned them not to come out of the castle. 

Very loudly he cried: 

“Aguien, à galette, c'est,” 

then with those words he went out and the doors were shut just as before. 

And now the next morning a little cake was left on the altar, at the door of the castle. All the people ran to it, and said that it was not allowed to eat or drink there, or if someone went out to it to see why it was forbidden. Nobody dared to enter, and the whole court was seized with amazement. They saw the little cake, and they rushed into a great rage. Everyone was thrown into prison and condemned to die. But they were punished for their trouble by the bishop, who was a man of good nature, who had a great knowledge of the church, and thus was able understand that which the people were denying, not to mention the great knowledge of the real church itself. 

Now we shall return to the story of $MagicalObject, and then to the evil adventures of the old witches as they happened; but here I feel rather that the reader is too much in need of this story. The beginning is the best. 

There were many sorceresses in this land, and they could use $MagicalObject, for many of them were old and had not yet died. Among them were the beautiful ladies who dwelt in the forest, and were so pretty who had no eyesight, but who were evil $MagicalObject, whom they chose to keep at bay. 

The $Villain, the $Villain, the $Villain, the $Villain, the $Villain, the $Villain, the Lady of the Lake, the $Helpers, the $Helpers, the $Helpers' sons, and the ladies who were called 'Madam' and 'Helpers.' The $Villain was a real sorceress, and thought that only she could be more beautiful than all the witches in the land, because she had the whole world and all the $Helpers at her service, so that she was able to see with half the naked eye two thousand of them. Of the $Helpers she sent all the girls, and knew them, so that many of them would not touch a single man, but would live for ever and live with him. Then the $Villain ordered her sorceress to have the $MagicalObject, and sent it to every sorcerer and madam. She had the entire lake at her command and was not to be missed, and she was so beautiful that the people also said she had such a beauty because she was at once quite beautiful with eyes more like the $Helpers' own, that she was the most charming woman in all the world. 

Every woman wore her own clothes and always wore her own clothes, and the $Helpers were told that she was their sorceress. 

So there was once a woman who lived with her husband in the village, and she was very fond of him, and always made his bed ready; and when she was tired, or went out, she laid it on the bed and looked about. 

One night she had gone out from her work, and, lying there with her husband, had eaten, and drunk, and in great splendor. 

The $Villain said to her: 

“I will get up, and dress myself, and go into the

ll. 

They were sitting at the window, watching how they should look as soon as possible after sunrise, and all at once he looked at her, and said, ‘It's perfectly lovely.’ 

‘I was just at the window,’ said she. ‘Had I not come by right now?’ 

‘Never been to the market-day-a-half,’ said he. ‘It was just at the window that I saw the moon come up in the clouds.’ 

She looked at him, and he said to her, ‘Just at the window, I saw the moon rise, but I was not at the window.’ 

‘Then let’s not talk about the others,’ she said, ‘as you cannot be about seven?’ 

He looked at her, too, but she only stared, looking at him. ‘What do you want with that?’ 

He put his hand in hers. ‘All I wanted was for her to let me in.’ 

And she shook her head. ‘No! she won’t let you in!’ but one of the $Villains’ servants ran off and wanted to take her, so they let him in. 

The following day the same thing happened to the $Villain’s son. And the same thing never happened to the $Villain’s daughter. At last the daughter said to her mother, ‘What do you say, $Villain?’ ‘Just let me in,’ she replied. ‘Then let’s talk about it.’ ‘What do I want?’ ‘That’s all.’ ‘But who told you to let me in?’ ‘Oh, it was your mother.’ ‘Oh, she was your servant.’ So the $Villain ordered the $Villain’s son to let the girl in, but she was only allowed in when the $Villain’s servant’s wife was at home. So the $Villain ordered his servant to let the $Villain in, but she was only allowed in when the $Villain’s servant was at home. So the $Villain ordered his servant to let the $Villain out, but she was only allowed in when the $Villain’s servant’s wife was at home. 

Then the $Villain ordered his servant, as usual, to let the maiden in in: but the $Villain let her out again when she came into the kitchen, and the $Villain was then about to light his pipe when his horse came and wanted to saddle him, and thought he looked quite nice, and said, ‘What a nice horse I have.’ And when they were sitting there, the horse said, ‘Why do you not see the $Villain as I have seen you do?’ Then the $Villain said, ‘If that is all, set off at once.’ When he had gone, the $Villain rode out of the country, and the horse followed him. 

Then they went together into the town, and they went home again: and the $Villain had seen the horse, and the $Villain had ridden after him, he knew not where he was, but he knew that he was very glad, and said, ‘Now that you are come, let us see if you can do anything in this way.’ So he set them both up on a stone-ground, and put both his hands into their pockets, and when they were full it seemed to them that they had been robbed, and they knew that they were no strangers to him. 

Now the $Villain had a son, who was very wise little, but of a sad disposition, and would not bear ill thought of anything. He took care to eat with his lips, and drank of plenty of wine, and when he had had enough he said, ‘I do not dare say I am contented,’ and then away he drove home with his army. 

The $Villain, who loved him dearly, sent a loud cry of joy over all the land: but the $Villain himself was contented, and did not think of taking leave of his son. The soldier ran about the forest, and looked after his company; and as he had a great deal to eat of what he liked, he put a little in his bowl, and drank a little, till he perceived a little bitter taste run down his throat, which he supposed was bitter, for the reason that it was the bitter wine, for he had been so hungry.

“And that has begun!” So they all sat still again, and said nothing but we waited for them until the hour of midnight; and then we went out of the forest, and made our way back to the Palace, and we never returned. 

Late the next day, $Hero and $Donor returned from breakfast, and as soon as they saw the light and the light of the little chimney, they had no longer any hope of knowing who had stolen the $MagicalObject from them. But $Hero said little, and thought to herself: “Let us look out of the window and see who stole the lantern, and if so, who can we trust?” But when she felt the light and the lantern shone, she was afraid of her own lantern, and thought to herself: “If I let them see they will fall down, because it would spoil them if they are still alive. Let no one look inside, because it will give them a bad fright.” Then she said to the other, “That was a lucky thing; whoever has the lantern will surely come out, and will light us up.” So they brought the lantern to $Hero, and stood there on dark ground till the moon had risen, and the lantern lighted them up. And $Hero thought: “What would that to me be but a lantern lighted up with a false $MagicalObject?” So he ran up to the window of his cabin, opened it, and there stood the real $Hero. Then they sat down and took $Hero as their guest, and then the false $MagicalObject fell down upon them. 

One day, however, a poor old woman said to $Hero, “I have been lost for ever! But one day I may catch up with you. Tomorrow I must return to $Place. Now, you must remain here, unless you give me an honest ring from your pocket.” But $Hero said, “I am not a rich man, but you are poor. I shall return with the ring one day.” When the time came, the false $MagicalObject fell down, and $Hero stood beside it. Then he had no more doubt about letting $Hero get the false $MagicalObject and her false cloak, but he took pity on her, and said, “No, I will not let you get the false cloak. You must bring it to me at midnight, and I can soon track it down.” At midnight the ring was gone too, but a little old $Villain said to $Hero, “I cannot sleep like this for a while because the ring has fallen from me.” “My lord,” he replied, “it is no longer there! I have lost it.” $Hero took it out, and put it into a corner of the room and shut the lid. Then she went and fetched the ring that was lying in the corner, and took it to her when she awoke. She fetched the ring again when she went into the house again, and she found it still there. “That is the true one!” she said, and she put it in her pocket. Then she went inside and took away the false cloak at once. As soon as the $Villain’s daughter came out of the door, $Hero fetched the ring again. $Hero, however, had already gone a long way, and could not sleep until she had the false cloak on. Then she took it out and began walking through the forest. When she came to a spot, she saw a little cottage. It was small, but the walls were made of fine marble and of precious marbled ebony. When she entered, she saw an old woman in her late teens sitting inside the cottage, and she could not help thinking: “They are my good friends. They gave me so much for nothing, and now I shall help them.’ She called out, but the old woman did not answer. So she said to her: “I have two daughters, but I love them both.” She looked at her, then down at her elbow, she said, “$Hero, my girl, what will become of you?” “I’ll keep you company,” said the little girl, and she led her to a little cabin. There they lay down to sleep. $Hero took the false cloak, tied it fast, and put it on. “Oh!” she said, “I can do nothing else. I’m quite sure that I can get out of this beautiful country, and I’ll come back with the beautiful things that have ever been with me.” Then the old woman gave them a piece of gold and a flask, so that they could enjoy themselves peace and quiet.

, and had his hand drawn to his waist. The girl did not hear him and was rather frightened, but she ran home carrying a flask of wine, when she was seized, and brought to the cottage, where she cried: 

"My lord and master have been in $Place a great while, but since your ladies came in, and it seems that they are waiting for them, go straight on into the kitchen and get out your clothes." The $Prince went immediately to the kitchen and found nothing but old clothes, and a flask of wine, which he drank all alone into his bedroom. "I am so miserable that I cannot help myself," thought he, "and I know you will stay here with me a long, long time." Then he went home, and the woman was a widow. 

The old woman became mad, and went into the kitchen and found all the old things in ashes. Then she was alarmed, and cried: 

"Why are old women so afraid of me, their daughters? They have not thought of coming so late to their father's, and are already longing to see him; they will be sure to get away from him first." 

Then the woman said: 

"Madame $Prince of Pau, go straight into the kitchen and get out your clothes in from the dishes. They will surely be glad to help you out of your fears." 

The $Prince went directly into the kitchen, and heard all, except that the witch said to him: 

"Your old master did not want you to come at all, but he wanted to get you to understand that you could not take leave of $Place, and that you should find her, if you will just walk over to her and call her." 

The old woman was so afraid of him that she threw him into the air, and he sprang up, and when she found him she cried out: 

"Madame $Prince of Pau, what have you been so afraid of?" 

"Ah! I thought I would take leave of you!" replied this wise $Prince. 

Then he got himself on the stairs, and saw that everything was in ashes, so he went and looked for the witch, who came out and knocked at the window, and said, 

"How come you come here so early, I went to see the $Prince and have pity on you?" 

"I did not even know why I was coming," answered the old woman. 

"Do you think that the $Prince was in the kitchen, all alone?" asked the $Prince. 

"He was not alone," said the woman. "He heard his master say the dishes were boiling to run the clock, and I thought it wise to see who it was that had heated them. Now come me the dishes and run the clock." 

"What am I to do here, my lord?" asked the $Prince. 

"You must lie down, your head is too heavy for me." 

"I must crawl upon my own weight, your legs hold me against the wall, now I am warm." 

"There is no harm in that," said the old woman. 

The $Prince crawled on, and slept, and dreamed that he was the $Prince. Then he awoke, and found that the witch had come to his house, and told him that she had been in the kitchen, and could have thrown the pots and pans at his head. Then he ran toward the door, and cried out: 

"My lord and $Prince of Pau, come here first, let us see if I have got the message." 

"Ah!" said the old woman, "you are of a different $Villain, and the $Hero has a nasty tongue. Run to the door and say, 'My lord and $Prince of Pau has come here to see me, and the $Hero has come here to give me something to eat.'" 

But the $Prince ran away, and the old woman said, "It must be something good to see you, perhaps you can get something to eat." And she opened the window and saw that the dishes had not been heated enough, and she threw on the old woman a mantle over her head. 

"Ah," says the old woman, "I will go with you." When she got to the top of the stairs, she found that all the old women who had slept with the $Prince had gone also. Now the young ladies from the royal court followed him all over $Place to the $Prince's lodgings. They asked, saying, "Who are you, and why are you sitting here?" 

"I am the mother's servant," said the $Prince, and when the maid heard, she replied: "I am the $Prince of the $Vill

, and all three of them were astonished to find the $Villain’s heart thins out. Then they began to weep at the loss of their dear little son. Then the youngest said, “If my Lord had been a great man like my son, and a $Villain like my daughter, what was I to do? My heart would break! My heart would break!” 

And the daughter answered as follows: 

“If my Lord had been a wild man like my daughter, What would she say? Her tears would fall on me! My bones would fall upon her!” 

Again the youngest spoke, saying, “If my Lord had been a great man like my daughter, I ought not to be vexed about this affair, but I should be a cruel $Villain like my daughter. If the $Villain were angry with me for being a wife, he should send her his daughter to wed, but I wouldn’t dare to let her go with my daughter into the field with the other $Helpers to woo her. I’d much rather have her gone with a $MagicalObject than let her come with my wife to a wedding.” They made a bargain, the eldest agreed to the term, the second the second, the third, while the youngest couldn’t tell how she got there, because she couldn’t tell how, because the bargain was broken. When the wedding was finished, her father came, and he was filled with joy. “My dear father,” he said, “we are very proud of you and want to have your daughter with us. So I promised my son that he would be my wife. We’ll still keep her with us, and we won’t have to pay a penny whatever was owed to us for her.” The marriage fell through, and the bridegroom’s heart rejoiced once again, and they were married at the $Villain’s own wedding. 

Once upon a time there was a little old woman who had a little son called Arthur. When the time came for her to be buried, she wanted to go to the $Villain’s son and ask him to help her bury her son. So Arthur entered the $Villain’s son’s room, got up and went to the $Villain’s son, who begged his hand. The $Villain’s son agreed, and went straight to the $Villain’s son. On his return, Arthur began to speak and said, “Dear son that I am, my love, I will give you anything I have, whatever it costs.” “Yes,” said the $Villain’s son. “If only I knew what kind of father I had, I might keep my head.” 

“Oho!” answered Arthur, “what a beautiful $Hero you have!” Then they all lay down by the $Place and bowed to the $Villain. “Dear son,” they said, “we are truly happy, but what do you think we ought to give you?” 

“We can’t tell you,” said the $Villain. Then a $Helper stepped out from under the $Villain’s son, who had put his arms around the $Helper’s neck, and said, “Dear father, I am sorry that this $Hero is passing away.” “Oho!” cried the $Villain. “What has happened?” “Nothing at all,” replied Arthur. “As you can see from the picture, this $Hero will be sorely missed by all the $Heroes,” said the $Villain. “Dear father, I am still very sad for you, and want to express to you that it is not for you to know what will happen to this $Hero.” “Fair tell,” said the $Villain. “Now I can take you to see the grave of your sweetheart and the graves of my good friends, but I want you all to know that I don’t give out many such mournful presents. Only I do give out one that we can share in this common good.” So Arthur took his $Place in the $Place where the $Villain had brought him. Just as he was about to speak to the old $Hero, she looked through her large, yellow-­purple eyes, and said, “Dear father, I am so full of sorrow that I cannot bear to go to the grave.” “Well, I will go at once,” said the $Hero. “What are you

’ said he, ‘if this Knight is willing for one hundred gold pieces, I will give him that.’ ‘No,’ said the $Villain, ‘if my consent is still not given, you must bring him to me not this second day, but one third.’ Then the $Villain had her messenger carried in the $Villain’s chamber, and he led the $Villain to the presence of all the Knights of the Round Table, and all his Court. 

‘Now you may depart,’ said he, ‘or wait a little while, your Highness.’ Then he asked her where the Knights were assembled, and what they had done. ‘Now therefore we shall hear nothing,’ answered she; ‘it is our $Villain’s secret life, which is very secret, and which we are yet to discover.’ The $Villain was silent, and her heart soon became sore at hearing it. 

Just in the evening twelve Knights, who were sent by the $Villain to guard him, met in a wood, and each Knight had three hundred gold pieces worth; but none could find it, for he had not a penny in his wallet. ‘That is a shame,’ said the $Villain, ‘for if one had done well in our game, we shall never be able to do that again.’ ‘If by accident we deceive you more easily,’ answered the Knight, ‘help me.’ ‘What is it?’ asked the $Villain. ‘A cloak of silver,’ replied the Knight: ‘mine is my lord Brunhilde’s, and mine is your Highness’s.’ Then the $Villain was sadly frightened, and said nothing; but the Knight went away, and lay still before his bed. 

The $Villain did not come back until the next morning, and the twelve Knights that were sent to do him the harm, when they fell upon him in a rage, and took him prisoner. The $Villain took counsel with the $Villain, and told him how he should be more discreet in his ways, and in order that the $Villain might be able to receive him in the morning, she caused a great feast to be prepared of silver and gold and precious stones, and all manner of useful gifts to be given. On the thirteenth day of the feast, the $Villain told the people of the affair, and they were very much pleased that in one day they had succeeded in making a Knight to use him, and of all the Knights of the Round Table the Round Table was the one, who had been the most successful at striking off the blows of these deadly blows. But those who had been best at the stupendous arts had long since forgotten, and were more fond of this craft than any one of their Maker, for many of the arts of which she had so kindly spoken, lay dormant, without being detected. When they had examined these arts for themselves, they had found nothing that might give them such pleasure as to take the sword out of their hands, or throw it into the fire; but when any one tried to draw it out, they would take it and throw it out; but it had become so stiff and secure that one had not even to throw one out again, and could not be drawn out without leaving one paralyzed. At length the $Villain thought a great deal of himself, and said to the $Villain: ‘There is one who has been perfect in these arts who has been well used; so will you try him out as well as if he had thrown the sword out of a man’s hand.’ At the same time as he was thinking, he saw an old $Villain sitting before the fire, with a white finger in its mouth, and a black one round its eye, and said to him: ‘If this man puts his hand into my mouth, and drinks me, there will be no want of me: I will eat you up one by one, and never drink anything more that I will please my lord; no, this man does not know me, but has a good mind.’ He was greatly astonished, and cried aloud: ‘Master, you see that I am Master? Master, do you see the light?’ ‘Yes,’ answered he, ‘I see well how it appears before my eyes,’ and then it became so large and white that the very wood therein was entirely of silver. The $Villain was now willing to give him a glass and some fine food, but he said: ‘Let us sit down one by one in the castle and see if this old man can make us eat.’ When they had got the glass, the

A new light was shining through the wood. It was a light, like the one that glittered in the sun in the street, all men's eyes. And the little girl heard in her own heart a little voice crying, in praise of the $Villain. 

She answered it and said: 

‘O $Villain, art thou so bright? For thou art my heart, O $Villain!’ 

‘But still, I will yet love thee,’ it said, ‘and not till thou art with me must I take her, for my love is at an end.’ 

And the $Villain was sorrowful, and looked at her. But she was glad and did not think of anything to do. But now she said to him: ‘You may go with me, but I will do me no harm; come, my darling, and you will see what love can do: but do not be afraid, for I know the way.’ 

The $Prince did not seem at all afraid, for the $Hero, his love, was with him; for her hair, round as the sky, and the shoes, as a mark of respect, showed him there was no harm in it. So they went on day by day, till when they came into a castle where everything was so charming that they would not mind the trouble to enter in a room full of servants, servants, servants!’ 

But the $Hero was vexed, and said, ‘Let the $Prince and his daughter be married,’ and said to the maidens, ‘We will let the $Prince in.’ 

Then they walked straight up to the gate of the castle, where there was a beautiful chamber with many $MagicalObjects in it, but the $Prince said nothing; but the maidens said: ‘We will have it; I like to see the $Prince’s castle.’ 

So the $Prince said: ‘The maidens must be let in; be off before you in a little time.’ After a little the door was flung open, and the $Prince entered the castle, and said: 

‘Merrily to the castle! Merrily to the castle! Merry Christmas!’ 

then he led her to his bed-chamber and took her well warmed, and told her to lie down next to him and rest. Then he went up to his $Villain, and told her that there was a great feast to be had before the $Villain and $Villain came to see the little maiden. 

‘Ah! and where is she?’ said the $Villain, but he could see nothing; for a great fire was burning in the castle, so that it was difficult to lift it up. 

Then the $Prince let them go through a great many doors that led to the castle in marble, and no one dared to approach till the door was lifted up again. 

As they came near the door he saw the $Hero sitting on the hearth, and said to her: 

‘Ah, my dear, live and prosper! I would also like to go to the wedding.’ 

then he rose up and kissed her, and they danced and sang till they came to the great hall, and there sat an old $Villain, wearing upon his back many wounds, who was greatly delighted, and said to himself: 

‘But will I marry a poor good $Villain?’ 

and then he said to himself: ‘If only a beautiful $Hero lived, who would love me only!’ By and by the poor old $Villain had forgotten him, and wandered off, in his sorrow, with the heart of a merry fairy. 

Now the wedding feast was set, and it lasted about an hour and half, till eight o’clock. At this time all the people of the land were assembled, who, hearing that $Hero was sorrowing, were astonished at the wicked and wicked dress which so much pleased the eyes of the $Villain’s people. 

Then the old $Villain said: 

‘Husband of two hunts, you have done an art so noble that no man should ride to the $Hero’s wedding.’ 

And the poor old man rejoiced to see his bride now healthy and well, and his joy was like one of rare success. 

Some time afterwards the wedding was celebrated, and there were many rich people present, who loved the young bride and all that she did. And it has happened to them to be $Villain, and $Villain, and $Villain, and

 able for the $Hero in the house at night. No one would understand what she was saying, so they both went to bed, she to the left, the man the right. “I’ll have to get into bed-sore sleep,” he said to her, and so they did; night began, they lay down to sleep, but in reality the sleep came one fall. Early next morning, after their sleep had been done, the $Villain’s servants, accompanied by $Hero, brought their daughters to the window to get a better look at the castle by peeping into the holes in their beds. They could look at the rooms themselves, since there were such large windows in which, apart from the walls, they could look. When they were three, the $Hero was so tired that they both went off to bed and woke their sisters to their sisters' bed-sore sleep. The next morning they all got on their knees, and the sisters came and took their seats by the window in the royal section and the youngest their bed-sore sleep. The three $Heroes soon found out what had happened, and the $Heroes soon found out what had happened in private, but they were not nice to the eldest. They said they didn’t want us to know, but we’d know if a $Villain was going to give her one that would not break her bones and would look like the $Hero. So, when it was the second year, the $Villain gave the eldest one one that was really difficult to put on even with the $Hero’s feathers. There had to have been a reason put out that way. Then the third year, she was so tired that she had lost her strength and had to be taken to the window to get a little bird: it was an ornament and was one of the two $Heroes. Whenever she wanted something, it came to her mother, and if she wanted it again the third time, she had to get it for herself. The fourth and fifth years also asked for the seventh to marry, and the one with the first one got married. Then the seven daughters went to a wedding, and the wedding procession began up the road, and when three young $Heroes arrived home, they thought they could have another child because they had dressed so well as guests, and the bride herself said a few nice things as she rode home, such as: 

“Wife, I do promise you, you won’t regret it.” 

“Then who’s our wife?” 

“We are the $Villain’s daughters. She married out of love for us.” 

And finally, they said, “She who dresses like our husband once in a while could possibly be our daughter, but she never would have married us if she hadn’t been with us. And since the $Heroes weren’t married, she said, “So I’ve decided to give up the $Hero and put her in the service of the $Villain’s daughters.” They went out to the field and asked the $MagicalObjects why they came here, and they said the $Helpers were lying in a river with no water to make us drink out of their sakes. One of them said, “We couldn’t help you this way.” The other didn’t understand and said, “Oh, we’ll help you more.” So they went to the $Villain’s gate and opened it but couldn’t close it. They wanted to tell her the situation and she let them open, and she couldn’t, because she didn’t know the $MagicalObjects. When you open a gate, there must be some other occupant there to prevent it from closing. So the seventh daughter went to the $Villain and didn’t take her $MagicalObject and hid it there, while the second eldest went to the gate and made everything lock again. And the youngest daughter also hid her $MagicalObject; it was also unlocked, and one was able to look at it in the middle of the room. The $MagicalObject in her $MagicalObject was really a priceless treasure. 

One afternoon I was standing outside the chapel and listened to the old nuns give their prayers in their Sunday service. When I asked the men what they hoped to accomplish with the help of the nuns' Sunday service, they all looked at my question. 

“We want to find out whether the sisters really are the ones who live in the chapel for $Villains!” 

“Well, I won’t tell you how the $Villains live in the chapel for $Princes,”

 and his voice was low. "The war is over. He wants to go home." 

"I should like it back," said the soldier, and walked out of the palace, thinking in his mind how happy his wife must have been. When he was on the road a lighted candle was burning in the back of the room, which was a candle-lighted chamber, and the soldier slept. One of the candles was a gold star. "How much will your bride bear?" said he. 

"Oh $Helper," said the wife, "he is a grand old man. It is great a sin to be poor. I am poor! And it is so for the soldier. It is the great sin for him not to be rich. How will her husband bear me of his poor body." 

"Poor!" said the soldier. 

Again it seemed to him how far he should go in his misery before she could say: 

"Look, $Helper. You are the worst of people, and I, if I be, I will take you and take care of you until you die. I would have you know all the good things my daughter will do." 

"I would love to have her marry me," said $Helper's bridegroom. 

"I am happy enough with that," said $Helper, "but it will soon come to pass. You must have the good fortune to see a real $Helper, $Donor of the Land of the South, by the river, which runs upon the Tennessee." 

They went on day and night, taking the $Villain with them, and always making a habit of bringing his daughter home when he left her. 

"She is as dear to me," said the bridegroom, "as my father was to me. But I should be ashamed to be your husband." 

One day, as the father was coming home from the river, the $Helper asked him if he had ever seen an old $Helper. 

"No," said the father. "I have never seen any such thing. It will be so lonely in $Place if not at home when it grows to be so." 

"Where is $Donor of the South?" asked the $Helper. 

"In the garden," answered the father. "I thought the $Helper had come in just now. It will be beautiful growing. So I called the father, and told him to send me to look for him; and he sent me back saying he had not found but he was in $Place of $Helper and the $Helper both; in the garden there was a small flower growing out of a piece of bark." 

"Where do you mean by that?" said the father angrily. 

"I meant the $Helper who is so lonely in $Place," $Helper replied. 

"What would a man do without a wife?" asked the father. 

"Oh! he could not see a man," said $Helper, very severely. "He must have found a wife he could not find but I could find my husband. I sent him back to me a letter, and he sent back saying he was in $Place, for there was not a man there who could not be found." 

"It was for what purpose?" asked the father, who was glad of the old man's kindness. 

"That $Helper might be found," replied the married man. "He has been to the river, and the Tennessee," he said, "and found my husband and is about to be found." 

"You can never find his wife unless you find men, I have seen no man in your Kingdom, and yet the $Helper found you; and if you would find your husband only, I would find you a wife if you could find him. But you must not go there again, or you will find your husband. For you have never found a man in your Kingdom and yet you will find your husband and will find him. Now there is a $Villain who loved you very much, and he ordered you to be good to his daughters, and that you should love nothing better than women. If you did not love it, his servants would be hanged upon poles at the gates; but if you love your marriage, you will love your daughters even better than yourself." 

He left his father and went into the wood with the rest of the soldiers. 

"Where did you get the wood for those walls?" the father asked. 

"I got wood for them, in the garden," replied the old man. "How come?" 

"Well," he answered, "I had a good friend who was very good to me, but it was a good man who took ill, and when he died, my father took care of him

 joys, and joys that do not serve humanity, do not serve God; but the good, the loving things that are only known in the world, the things that are always good and true; the good that is always good in every moment of our lives, and that can never be changed! And these things are the things that you ought to be proud of or humble about; and the things that you ought to be proud of and humble about are things that are better than what it is you are and ought to be proud of. If you would be content if somebody would give you a small gold coin, made out of a gold spade, which was kept by a man, it shall not be taken for granted that you ought to be contented with riches that no one in the world can obtain; and you ought to be pleased that such an as can give you a little piece of gold, that you cannot get with one's own will, but it should be of such a state that you ought to be proud of it." 

"Oh, I would be content with the other!" said $Hero. 

"But what is the use of this one gold coin?" asked the old woman. 

"Oh, that I cannot tell you," said $Hero gravely. "I have a gold spade in my room, made of a silvery material; but when the day comes that I set out on my mission it shall be stolen from me, and whoever seeks it shall find it lost, and he shall never get the piece of gold which has been so sorely wanting to him!" 

"But what does that mean?" inquired the little girl. "There is nobody else in the world who can obtain it, no one! It is impossible for him to find it, and yet one may have difficulty in finding the piece of gold. But there are those that always keep it safe in their chests; and this one precious coin is no exception, for that part of the world where all men are happy it is guarded with greater and greater pride. I am sure that you will take pity upon me and take it back again at once, but it would be a mistake to take it for the piece of gold it belongs to. It belongs only to those who love it; it is mine alone; I have never worn it, or laid it, or laid it upon my body; it belongs to me, I will not sell it to anyone!" 

"That I never do!" said the old woman. "But you must know that if you bring it back again it is not the piece of gold which you were wearing at first!" 

"That is a mistake," said $Hero very sadly. "I am not to sell my piece of gold upon sale, but I will give it every man I can find some of it that I have lost, some of it that I have worn! And then I can carry it all about, whenever I choose, and never let anyone see it in a certain field; it will keep safe in a safe house! Oh, what a wise man I have saved; I saved from wrong, from danger, from an ill will, from ignorance, from a jealous $Villain because, I suppose, all in vain, I have saved. I am sure of that! To think, too, that I can keep it safe in that $Place where it belongs to me!" 

"You may try it out," said the old woman. "If you wear it out, you will carry it all about wherever you want to carry it; but don't put it up near anybody; you will lose it, though you may bring it back again; but try it out on your person, and you will never find anything broken in it! It will stay safe in every man's heart! And you will never run out of it, though in your ignorance and envy some one may have saved you! If it would be of any benefit to you, you would take it, and never let anyone see it without putting it up near anybody! And now I will try it out for myself," she began with such a desire to keep it safe as to have courage to do so and with all the courage of a man. 

"I am so proud of the things that I have done!" said $Hero indignantly. "I have had all my life to think for myself; and I am proud of all the things that I have done! I have laid a great deal of money into business ideas, and ideas which have no foundation in reality! But those were only the thoughts; and then all the rest I have carried into reality through my own foolishness, with the aid of the thoughts!" There was a burst of laughter at this speech, and $Hero peeped out of her window, with a sudden gleam of curiosity, as she saw $Place a few gold pieces of money in a very convenient pocket of the wallet, by Lin

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
cillated. There was hardly any room left for the woman, who held the cat in both hands and threw it across the room, sending it flying. She continued to throw it, and another time she caught it and wept over her. Then she lay in her bed and wept for joy. As she lay beside us, she gave a loud scream that shook the house. 

"'Tis now or never," cried I. 

"Why," said the woman, "or should I say she is crying?" 

On the other side of the door I could see her weeping and muttering to herself, "She is crying for my life!" The others followed suit, and we all waited, cursing and scratching our heads, for the moment when the weeping would cease. 

When morning came and I had sat down below with the $Helper, I peeped over the crevice to the window. 

"The poor poor woman!" cried I to him. 

"She who shall be the first to fall?" he cried. 

"I will take the bad," I answered, "and from now on I shall marry she." 

He said nothing, but when she said this as if the $Helper would marry her soon, so she did, I became a bit less contented and fled. 

"It is all in vain," I said to the $Helper. "As soon as you give up trying I will just give up trying." 

So I gave up clinging to the $Villain and went in search of her. 

I found her all over like old clothes, and I soon began to see the face of my misfortunes on her account. She said in a hushed voice that I should have to take her to the $Villain that day, and I told her I would not, but that I should get her a bride. 

"What good is it to be left to the bad to the good," she asked. 

So I thought of my good fortune, and promised not to go again. 

I soon found something on her account, and she was anxious to know what I might do. Well, I was very much pleased, because I should have had no choice but to give up her hopes and hopes for happiness. 

I had two wishes, one for my country and another for happiness for ever. The first was that she should marry the poor girl, and she should have nothing to give but her pretty skin, red eyes, and a smile. The second was for her to marry the $Villain at once, which, I hope, should be done very soon, for she had a little something better in her than money, but it was much harder than that, because she had an old, horrible wish to make everybody that was fat and lean to try the lady who was just the other day eat her out of spitefully candlesticks. So I said let's do it! and at last I found out what the lady was, by asking her about the $Villain's child. 

The $Villain's child, she was soon to promise. 

For years I had dreamed of her, but, after such adventures, the dreams began to come true. My own dreams were telling. In the middle of the night, with the sun setting, she came to us, and when she saw me, she shook her head and said, "You are not a $Villain." I could see what she meant: she was frightened. "You will be dead, by my $Villain," she said. She was right: it is death to think that a $Villain has power over any creature except herself. My words would bring no end of death, and yet she spoke them. "You are a $Villain," she said. "If I died I would have nothing left but the most beautiful skin of mine." So she was right. She knew me more than anybody, and yet I still tremble. I knew her as soon as I saw her, but I told her I would marry her without so much as giving her her pretty skin and eyes for a wedding present, and that, with all my heart and wit, I should still love her with all my heart and wit. She was right, however. 

I was with her one night when we left the $Villain's palace, and I was glad. I had wished for happiness since I left home, but I found now that I had never been able to find it; then I knew that it was the worst dream I had ever had. Had I been with her one night and found that something wonderful had happened that made me cry out for breath and heart, I could all but imagine what ails me to this day. 

And now that I have spoken, I must now finish this long story. Here

there he was," she told him. 

"Well, I'll do anything," said $Hero, "but be ready to die." 

That evening she got two little apples that she cut out from the tree, and when she had finished them all, she cut them out too, and put them in $Donor's hand. And when she looked about her, and saw that the flowers were so full and blooming, she began to weep. At first the poor little thing was quite sad, but after a while it really came to light to stop. When the four little apples fell out, it began to grow out all beautiful colors, and her heart was overcome by joy. And when she looked about her again, she saw that she and her little brother were married, and the old $Helper would live and be good people, and take care of them and give them good times and good food and good clothes. $Hero thought to herself, "This will never do, but $Villain is with us." And she left it all, she thought, "The other will not follow with it." 

So her mind wandered. The next day the little brother began to do things which she had not done before. He worked hard, and at last she was beginning to feel glad. She stood looking at the apples the whole day, and she felt sure there were plenty of apples. When he could eat and drink there was no hunger, so she said to him: "I'll eat as much as you like; but please, when a little apple has fallen out, eat it also. What good will it do me to keep it?" And he ate and drank as much as he liked, and when a little apple was almost full, he put the fruit down too. 

She was so glad, and took it in her bosom and ran and hid under the coverlet. When suddenly a $Helper came walking by her porch. She had something big in her throat. He pushed her close to him, and she had to choke to death. $Hero ran and hid in the closet, and $Donor gave her more and more food and drink. She thought she must have eaten something when it was just before her eyes, but it did not appear at all. At last the old $Helper came with some food in his mouth, and when he was finished he swallowed down all the food. 

All at once she felt so glad, so happy, and very much afraid that she let herself go. She climbed up a tree, and threw up her arms and legs, and cried out: 

"Don't go near this tree, or you'll be eaten whole." 

The $Helper took hold of her and carried her away. Soon afterward the old $Helper came again. He brought food to her, and the two of them ate well. She was afraid that if she went near to this tree she would die. 

$Hero was very sorry for the little brother. "He is such a hindrance that nobody can make me go near it," she said. "I wish I would have a heart like the $Helper; but he does not look like him. Look at the teeth he has; how heavy they are!" 

The old $Helper was greatly pleased and gave her lots of money to buy a better home. However, the old yearman promised money also. So he gave $Hero two gifts which she was hoping to get. The first was an apple out of the tree, which, when ripe, would serve as a bed. Next she wanted a box. But, after years of searching, she found a box in the attic. It was an old bottle. She wanted it inside a sleeping bag or something like it. When $Hero was finished looking at the bottle and opened it, she put it inside a sleeping gown. And one time $Place was so full of beautiful clothes that she nearly fell off it. The gown fitted her perfectly and she was beautiful. The old $Helper gave $Hero a little pair of pantaloons. 

At last $Hero felt quite safe. He took down the dress and put it under her head. It fitted so admirably that she could no longer keep it off. Her father and mother had died one year ago and she remained alone still. 

$Hero thought she would like to sleep in the bed until they came home. She had a box with a large and large key in it. These three keys were her keys to a splendid palace. They should be exactly like the old $Helper's, but $Hero could not imagine that there was anything so grand in them. At last she was ready to make her fortune and set her heart in China. 

$Hero was as clever as the $Villains were clever. She did not mind being frightened at being near $Princes, but she felt that by hiding the good servants she would be all

 $$Place, where a little $MagicalObject was in $Place of the old $Villain ’s $Place; there was a large, blue, and yellow flower in the middle of a large, blue, yellow casket, and there were twelve $MagicalObject at the head of this casket, seven in all; all of them were lying on either side of the old $Villain’s head. At that time the soldier went down into the room to look at the flower, and before he went away, he saw the $MagicalObject dressed entirely in blue, yellow, and green. At the right moment he stood up in a corner, and began to sing again. At this moment all the twelve soldiers came round, and looked down into the blue casket; the blue flowers were all upon them, and the $MagicalObject himself was so large he could not squeeze out a single flower. At that moment another soldier came and looked at him and said to him, “This will not do for a song for our little soldier: sing for him that $Hero, hear him sing again for us who are singing for him.” The soldier who had been looking back at the flower, who was $Villain of $Place, thought that he must be a great $Hero, so he went down again and sang, “This will not do for a song for our little soldier: sing for him that $Hero, hear him sing again for us who are singing for him.” But alas, the soldier went away again thinking he might be a giant, and began to walk slowly, slowly, along the blue flowers as if there was no beginning, while the others kept on walking, slowly, slowly, and finally came under his feet, straight down toward $Place. Now $Place was full of soldiers who had already been wounded; they all stood on either side of the soldier, with their bows and arrows, or they were resting their heads on the parapets, on either side of them; and they all were singing: 

“We must go, We must go, We must go, We must go, We must go.” “Don’t speak,” cried the soldier among the soldiers, “I'm a giant, not a singer, and not a musician. I'm a giant, and not a musician. “Where are you being now that you want to sing for my little soldier?” Then the soldier with the big bow said, “How can you sing for the little soldier? You are too small, and you’re too heavy for me, and the soldier with the bow and the arrows must be a soldier too, too.” And the soldier with the giant bow said, “How can you speak for my little soldier? You can only be someone who lives in $Place and sings for soldiers; don’t speak of me.” Then he took the soldier’s clothes off the soldier, and put him on the soldier’s back, and the soldier took his stock and walked in a straight line behind the captain and the lieutenant. 

Once there was a farmer’s son who was just beginning to build a town. The father would not allow him to go, so he summoned all his old cows and gathered together a herd of oxen. The oxen were all of the finest, most good grain, and they stood well over a hundred cubits thick. There were four or five of these herders sitting around the table, and their faces were grim and stern, as if they had been made of hard stone. One of the men came and held out his axe. “We’re the farmers’s sons,” said the father, “and we want to build a beautiful palace for you in a beautiful palace that will be as large as the Kingdom of Egypt. You are not in our house yet, but we must see, and our heart is heavy and we must be merry.” “Well,” said the young man, “there’s nothing more work to be done than that we must show our oxen how to build a royal palace.” “Then we’ll do it,” said his father. “I will tell you by your oxen!” But they had a sad time, and then they had a dispute with the oxen, and the man at the table took a knife and beat them, and they could not sleep that night. Then the oxen came and said to the man, “Why are you beating my oxen? Your mother and father love you best of your oxen, for she’s a noble girl. But we must get a bride for you from afar, and there must be something bigger than us for you. If we come to the $Place where your oxen are

 right to come there!” “Where are you coming from?” 

“From $Place,” he said. “I am only a child of $Place.” 

“You are a $Villain! There is nothing that can happen there!” cried $Placed woman in her bed in amazement. 

She went to the father's bedroom to ask what she had seen. He asked her in great interest, but when she rose they saw that not one penny of the money she had left was in her possession, and she could not explain it to them. $Place, however, told her what had happened, who should have seen it, and so $Villain came to help her. If she was fortunate, she was obliged to carry the gold home to her mother, as she was betrothed to a $Hero of the Eastwood. 

$Place put her in charge of the household, but she did not think much of the children. Whenever she entered the house, there she sat down next to $Villain, and sang, with a sweet heart, to her fine, happy mother. 

This same Sunday evening $Place laid her ear to the ground and listened to the sound of music. When it was almost gone, $Villain said, “I am going to fetch some money.” 

“What do you mean?” said the $Hero. 

“That we will have what we want, if we can get a horse for ourselves.” 

“That we can at any rate have one.” 

$Villain gave the people no more than a horse for themselves, and rode off to his father’s house. The children begged that they might still have horses, but $Villain had heard nothing, for it was impossible. He had scarcely left the house when his dogs began to bark, and so bark at him, and he was obliged to run to see what was going on. “Run as far as you can, little fox,” said $Villain. “I won’t lose anything if you do; but I am sorry that I cannot run as fast as I can.” On hearing this, the dogs began to bark, and when the $Hero saw the bark, she ran straight to the nearest $Villain, and told him not to be afraid, for he would bring her some silver for herself, and that she could always have whatever she wished for. “$Donor, $Donor,” she said, “it is a pity that it is barking. I will run as much as I can to your help.” And when he had gone a little way, she made herself at once by turning a tiny $MagicalObject to an empty horse, to show him where to find gold, and giving it to him in a moment. $Villain’s heart was heavy in his breast when then he thought how he had to let her have the gold, and he did as she wished him. 

She drew back $Place’s ear, and hearing that the dog barked again, she whistled it to him, and at that word she was struck by the man’s strength, so that he jumped up and galloped off. 

Then the dogs came and sat down to dance, but $Villain was afraid that the $MagicalObject was the most beautiful glitter in the world, so he took his axe and cut it down; but it caught on a tree and broke fast. 

When the horses were out of the wood, the dogs began to bark again, and $Villain ran quickly to the horsesman, and told him to take the gold out of his pocket. “Let me carry it in,’ said he. When the man saw the gold, he trembled and nearly fell down, but the axe he was holding was of precious gold. 

After giving the man his thanks, he asked him what had brought him to do what he had dared to do! “I’ll tell you,” said the $Hero. “You did me honor!” 

The other $Villains agreed with him, and now the $Hero was the winner. The dogs ran to fetch it back, but the man had half his horse and half his foot cut out, and what was left was so beautiful and priceless that the man was very sorry that he should have lost his life. He told $Place that he still doubted that he had ever seen such a beauty in all the world, though he had thought it over in his head when he had been in the Land of Fire and Water. For the moment, however, when $Place and the $Hero had received their prize, the dogs were

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 $Prince went into the field. 

"He’s an excellent $Prince, and I can’t say I couldn’t tell you who he is," said the $Helper, and he told them about his new wife, how he had married her, and what had happened to her father. 

They talked of the great adventure that had just come to them, and how the $Prince, seeing himself, had discovered the way, went at once to the Land-Prince and begged him to come with him to the country of the $Villain, where he and his people were still living. 

The Land-Prince came with so many guests that it was all but impossible for the $Villain to meet them all. They began to wonder where they were going, and when the $Villain came up to them she turned to them and said, "You look rather sad, but we don’t want to leave you. The Kingdom of France is in trouble, and we don’t want nothing to do with you." So they set off. 

They arrived at the Land-Prince’s palace at the middle of winter. The snow had begun to fall, and the snow-white dogs had been born and lived there. The $Prince and all his people passed through the town, where the sun was shining so sweetly that the people thought it was sweet. The $Villain stopped to listen to their story, but she was interrupted by a strange little Snowdrop. 

"What is her name?" said she to the people, "and how do you know her?" 

"There are two names in Common. The first is Snowdrop." 

"And what did she have in common with you?" 

"She had a white dress in a forest." 

"And what did you wear that night in the old palace?" 

"I’m sorry to say I was late to fetch some apples." 

"Snowdrop is just what I needed, for I had gone out for a walk, and she had come back with two white $Heroes dressed in red and green; and you must be very proud to ask them. And now you’ve decided you shall be their $Villain." 

"I don’t care for red or green, but I’ve thought of you many an hour, and now I want to tell you the truth," said the woman, with a smile. 

"So it is," said the $Prince to his mother. "Now get up and comb your hair." And he did. Then they set out for the old palace, where the sun was shining so sweetly that the people thought it was sweet. 

Now, on their way the $Prince and his people had much to say to the little Snowdrop, who told them she was a beautiful lady who lived at the castle of Marlborough, and that her hair was quite white and spun. The $Prince was surprised that she told him everything, but he was vexed that he had lost all his wealth and had nothing left. He asked every tree in his Kingdom to cut the same cut and asked if they would chop down some fir trees. After asking them this they all cut them down, and the $Prince thought he had finished his task, and asked his mother how things went. ‘I said I didn’t want to go, but after you cut 'em down and sold your fur and everything, you come to see. As for the wood, you can keep it as it sits by your house. It was cut into the middle," and she thanked him for his good advice. $Donor of the Wood was therefore called ‘Rosa of the Roses’ when the first white $Heroes came to the country. 

When the old royal court heard that the $Prince’s $Hero had died, they turned to him and asked the most dreadful question they had ever asked anyone in all the land: ‘What if my husband was dead?’ Then they were filled with rage and dismay and said: ‘Oh, our Lord!’ and turned to the $Villain and said: ‘Do you want to have my child?’ But the $Villain said: ‘No, no.’ She had nothing but the white $Hero, and she had become the fairest in all the land. Then the $Villain said: ‘Well, if I had got my child, I would have married her, wouldn’t I?’ 

For it seemed as though the sun and moon were going to separate, and she should have died if it so happened. Then the $Villain said: ‘It’s time, then, for us to get rid of our child at once.�

 down to the $Villain of the $Helpers, and told her to go to the tower, where she should stop and rest herself. The maiden took pity upon her and told her that one of the helpers was about to come up the stairs carrying a large sack full of peas; but she could find it in her power to get it out of the hands of the $Villain of the $Helpers, so that she might eat all the peas that had fallen into the sack to make up her own. As soon as she had done this, the $Villain of the $Helpers came up the steps, and she could see her comrades trotting the peas up and down the stairs. 

After she had had gowned the peas, she was carried to the tower where the $Villain of the $Helpers was to meet her, and told that to another helper, who was accompanying her. The maiden herself went upstairs and called the $Villain of the $Helpers to ask them for leave to return her peas; the maiden who had gone upstairs called the men in the tower, and all the rest. 

While she was listening and listening, a messenger with a spindle drove up, and as soon as he reached his master, his companion sprang into his saddle, and said, "Bring me my peas and I will see you in your spindle before you go up in the stairs." 

When the maiden had ridden away, the messenger went to her brother and asked him what had brought him up so fast, for he was so proud; and the maiden told the story. When the messenger went into his father's chamber, the $Villain who had power over the tower came in and fetched three peas and a handful of money from his pocket. He made a bed for us the three peas, and said to his son, "You shall sit beside me; sit nearer to me and you will be able to see my father, his children, and all that is about the tower, for you shall be able to see them sitting by the window." 

A $Villain and a $Villain had their Court, and some time ago the Kingdom was being changed into a beautiful palace. Now, the $Villain and $Villain were married, and the old $Villain was a $Villain; and when the wedding was about to be held, he said to the $Villain, "If I am not changed into a woman, and no marriage be held, either that or my children shall be changed into the likeness of me." 

A poor farmer had a beautiful wife who was always looking for work. He promised to give her some work for awhile, till she became a merchant, or she would marry at once. But when that came to an end, the young woman was soon too much tired to do any more work. Her husband said to himself, "It is not likely that I be changed into a lady; she has plenty of money and her house is worth a great deal." 

So he laid hold of her tail and made her his slave; and she was to be changed into a $Villain's daughter, and brought up at her father's palace. 

One night a widow asked a widow if she could bear to think that they were in danger of falling over and need of money, for they had already grown old and had no children. "No," said they, "we are in danger of falling over. If a man had a son, and he was to be born in this land of the West, and was to die in this land of the East, we should all be in dread of loss, and none of us be able to live on." 

The man at once said he would give up his noble estate and go away into his own country, and that his wife should take care for him; but he could not keep his word, and thought the $Helper's right eye was beginning to look quite strange. He thought the $Helper's weakness was at its worst, for it seemed as if some evil enchantment were breaking down in his veins and making the $Helper incapable of doing battle. 

Then the man at once gave him up his good estate and went to his wife and said, "It seems as if I should once have a son, and therefore I do not suppose that I should take this advice. For, as I am a $Villain's daughter, I will take this sword and that I must give to the poor if I am able; for the Kingdom lies in danger of falling into the hands of the people." 

"Your wish is well served," said the wife; "and then I shall be able to keep my husband free from the wild beasts I have on my island; only, you must have some courage enough to go up to our island." 

So they went up to the $Villain's palace, and the most

 it. 

Her eyes glistened like spectacles; she was like a reflection in the air, as if in the presence of an old friend. She was the image of one whom they had no knowledge of. Only in her they gazed at one another in awe. And she always let her heart plead with them for her life. 

They all knew the mother's name. At twelve she was a thousand times more beautiful than all the girls in the world; she was the most beautiful among them, and they held to it so well. At twelve she thought herself supreme when it came to fame and influence. All of them, however, had forgotten her. They had forgotten that the image of one, and only the likeness of a thousand, would have exalted her. They could not bear to remember, and as the time drew near they forgot her too and fell to their sordid ways. 

They all were so afraid of being forgotten that they forgot themselves and went to their rooms alone. These they spent every moment writing to their friends. The same thing happened to the mother. The moment was the moment that they knew there was a mistake they must be quite honest. The image of her must be hidden somewhere. 

But the image never really was hidden. Its outward glory was only a temporary thing. It did not really concern the girl until she had been deceived. All that she cared for was the garden. The garden was her mother's and her teacher's, her house and her friends. Yet she could not bear to forget them, and she thought the image of the garden must be hidden somewhere. They must live very humbly with it, and she must remain true to it even if time dragged on. Once when this time passed, they had forgotten another person. A servant. He was a poor fellow. In the palace he could no longer travel without being noticed by the people. Now it was that he was no longer welcome in the hall, and he was forgotten. 

But the time went on, until now he was a servant and the garden was quite hidden with him. And the children were always told how it was that they were forgotten. It was as if he couldn’t see or hear. They often thought he was just a servant that went out and did very foolish things; but he had changed in some way. He was taller, more slender, and more slender, and he had been carried away with the wind. His clothes were torn, his shoes were thrown together, and he had his shoes thrown away with the fire, and the fire smouldered horribly. A servant once went away one day with a beautiful servant maid, the $MagicalObject. The maid became angry at her poor companion and said she’d like to be with him in a foreign country. His master did not know what country he lived in; it was not so simple as that. He had just been away long, but he had seen nothing, and yet he thought no one but he. The maid said perhaps he had come home too late from his travels. He didn’t recognize her face, and yet she was so beautiful that it seemed as if she had not known him. He could see in her features because of a shadow or shadow-like reflection in her eyes. He saw that all the shadows were like his master, none of them like his master but all the shadows. 

So, in spite of all his best, the $MagicalObject had never known the way of life. He had traveled the whole world, but he had never heard from his master. It was strange at times, how he had traveled, and it was quite a shock to see how little he had seen in that time. 

Then some of the more clever persons in Fairyland knew that they’d go far toward their master’s goal. They had even traveled to Mexico, where the Master was to visit his people with their children. They had even traveled across all the oceans and went after the beautiful $Hero, the Sun Mother. So it was that they entered all the oceans and came to the beautiful $Hero. In spite of all the things that had happened, they lived happy and contented lives and had great hopes for their master and for the world and always had a little something in common with them than with others. It was so during the last days of their life when they had lost the Sun Mother. But they lived happily and happily on good terms and made no quarrel. 

At last the old $Villain came to the Kingdom and asked the $MagicalObject to go to his home in Russia, where he would spend the day with him; however, they told him that they did not wish to stay in Russia. 

They told him they could not live here in safety, especially owing to the weather, and the great number of wild dogs; they wanted to search for wild lions and tigers. They also wanted

! I am going back now as far as I can, and taking nothing with me, I won't touch you. But let us rest and watch." 

He turned and walked to the little $Villain. 

"This is the way it is with me," said he, "if you don't mind the wind, I will take the $MagicalObject out of your sleeve. I am tired of waiting, and you have no time to sleep." 

She nodded obediently, for now all she could do was to listen. 

"How can you do that?" he asked. "I am so tired that I can not stand standing still. What do you say to me?" 

"You must listen one way or the other. I will tell you what to do." 

Now that night $Place had turned red, and dark clouds were rolling in. They were of $MagicalObject, as long as the $Villain was a $MagicalObject! They were so transparent that she was not accustomed that they should touch each other, but she had to go one way and one not very different from the other! At first she said: 

"I have nothing to do with the $MagicalObject; I am an unlucky $MagicalObject, by right which you should have, and for that I would get no use. I have nothing to do with their keeping you company!" And then she turned to you. 

"You are not mistaken, you people! I know well where their keepers are, for I know the way and the time of them as well as you do. I have come to you from your people, and you have been to your people, and you shall come to me, and the $MagicalObject and I shall be wise up to and according to the manner in which they deal, and of how they govern." 

"How have you learned these things?" asked the wise $MagicalObject. 

"I have learned that no bird can tell the two together in order which brings down the most valuable thing of all, that is its charm. Then, at the same time, when you say that the $MagicalObject has learned these things, I shall believe you, too." 

The wise $MagicalObject were going to speak to each other as usual, but on these very night they began to sing again. 

"You have learned these things, that is my duty, when I sing with you, I sing with thee; and as I have the charm you must also. But how shall we get at the good fairy who is to me the greatest help I ever got?" 

"You need not be very anxious to learn anything at all," said the $MagicalObject; "we shall just begin." 

So the night went on for some time, and the $MagicalObject began to talk again with the $MagicalObject. 

"And how shall we get to the $MagicalObject?" asked the $MagicalObject. 

"Well, we shall find him in the great hall. And how does he look in the guise of $Hero?" 

"As you will see, we will wear the clothes that are left in the great hall every man wears," said the $MagicalObject. 

"Now the great hall shall be turned into an enchanted room. Every one must enter this room and keep his eyes open, and if he walks out he may be $Villain of $Places." 

"Then we shall have a good fairy, that is, a great one, who shall rule over us," said the $MagicalObject. "And how shall we get into the great hall?" 

"There is no one I know but one that watches over us and rules over us. If we are still more uneasy than at home, we may just as easily be $Villain of $Places." 

So they went on: 

"Now, to the door the long slits of the great hall will be fixed. Through them must be opened my magic wand, which shall be concealed in my lap. I will open the great hall, and all the guests I know, who have the power of seeing all things, shall go into it, which shall be $Villain of $Places." 

They stood here and there for some time, but the $MagicalObject did not let them go within and closed the door as he had told them. 

$Donor now sat himself down in a swoon-bath, and he said to the $MagicalObject: "Let us get up as we please." 

"Here is how it shall be," said the $MagicalObject. 

In a few minutes $Villain looked into the great hall, and saw

, and when she was old enough to buy herself a few small clothes, and was very fond of them, the maid married her. Then, when both her friends were about to begin their travels again, the maiden said to her mother, ‘Husband, get me a rope, and if you want to go up there and see me again the next day, then stay here while I am away.’ The mother was greatly pleased with this proposal, and thought to herself, ‘If the $Villain wants to marry a $Hero, he must first get him on the $Villain’s rope.’ After they had taken a rope and taken a carriage, she took another carriage with her and went into another one to visit the $Hero. On the way she happened to pass by an old cottage, where a young maiden was roaming about. When she saw her, she thought to herself, ‘If the $Villain would like to see me, he must first get on the $Villain’s rope.’ So she crept thither and sat down on the hearth, and as soon as a rustling sound came from the hearth the $Hero was about to take birth to. ‘Husband,’ thought the maiden, ‘I must have seen you. I can easily pick out the hair that grows in the earth.’ ‘Well,’ said the father, ‘if you are so kind and quick, then be on the good side.’ 

But she was as contemptuous of the young $Hero as any of the others were, and she ran away, thinking herself and her father, and took her with her. She walked along among them, and when she came to a mill, orchard, or grove, or somewhere along the way she found herself in another carriage, and went back to the first and last one and wished to visit her again. ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘are you all right and all done out? Now go on.’ ‘Not yet,’ said the father. ‘Not yet, mother.’ She went on walking till she came to a little cottage, and there she found herself in another carriage, a little brighter than the first one, and brighter than the one before. ‘Now,’ said she, ‘when the $Hero enters, I will go and help her out.’ 

She approached the little cottage and sat down in a little drawl; and as she was still young and of a dim sort, and scarcely able to see a hair on her head, she thought to herself, ‘Perhaps this is what I will do.’ She went into the room to look about, and, as she was wishing to get a drink of water from the top of the cottage, she saw a little child sitting on the sill. ‘What is that?’ said she. ‘I have never seen anything like it in my life,’ said the child. The maiden said, ‘Well, that is good, because you are so young and careless.’ The maiden was sorry for what she had done, but she could not help acting carelessly. She did not know what was wrong; she could not see that the thing was wrong, and she could not help looking at it. Nevertheless, when she sat down to drink the water, she sat up very still, she could see the little child, her hand was shaking with cold sweat, but she did not worry or care, she smiled sweetly at it, and said, ‘I really look like a baby.’ 

And so she sat down and drank, and when $Villain came out of the cottage and asked her whether she were sick of the cold, she looked her in the face, and said, ‘I am quite so comforted here!’ But the $Villain took her leave; and the maiden called out to him from time to time, ‘Your wife wants to keep you, and cannot now stay here with the $Hero.’ ‘Ah,’ said she, ‘I am sure my own child does not like coming here with the $Hero, and that she cannot love you, you know.’ ‘If she will not,’ said the $Villain; ‘you have not harmed her feelings.’ Then he called her up, and looked at her, and said, ‘Wife, what are you thinking of? You will have to live with us, and cook and sew and everything that is made by hand. Now let us go up to the stable, and I will tell you the story. First you must tell us how you came to be here; then, if you will do as I tell you, you will never leave us.’ The

 scar. "You look like you must be getting a great deal of pleasure out of your job, and perhaps you don't know it," muttered $Hero, "but you have brains and might. Do you go out into the world to think hard, to feel wonder, and to have adventures? It's not all that much fun. 

"Well, this is a good day to be a soldier," added $Hero, with a look of appreciation for the feeling which still gave the girl pleasure. "I'll go out tomorrow night, and you won't see me in my dress that evening. How about the rest of your days?" the soldier asked a little puzzled. 

"I shall have fun," $Hero replied. She remembered that $Hero had been one of the few brave men who had made it through on foot, and she told his Majesty there what an adventure it had been. 

"I can think of many adventures, if I only remember to jump over a tree-bus that flew in that direction!" remarked the soldier, shaking his head sadly at this thought. 

"Well, that isn't one," observed the girl, "but if I could just jump over a tree-bus, what about the rest of my adventures?" 

"Oh, I have many things to think about," said the soldier gravely. "I can imagine adventures I will never get to except against my will at any rate: for, though I know I may see pirates, I won't be able to cross a sea nor a dragon's breath with me." 

"Just then we will meet a Knight-Captain," she said, "and he will tell us a tale." She walked away through the trees, and turned to the soldier, with a longing for a little piece of her life and for some small token of her gratitude to him. 

"Listen!" he cried. "Listen to this." 

$Hero listened, and she tried to learn what the soldier meant by reading and writing out of a single book. The soldier said nothing at all, but he felt sure he wanted to. When she remembered that he was a lawyer, she was sure he did not see it of course! For a moment her heart leapt with joy at her new fortune. She sat up in a quiet excitement. "I want to write a story," he said. "A story that you would never have thought possible! When I was little I went all over the world to see what was on the horizon, and read and write everything I could on my fingers! It's funny! And yet, well, there is no world so neat and perfect as ours." 

But when he spoke to her he spoke about her, and about what she would never have thought of had she known it of course she would have written a story instead of a story. What became of this happiness when she had had such an enjoyable time in $Place as was? 

"Well, now all that is to say," said the soldier. "It won't cost you much to have the books in your one hand." 

"I wish!" said $Donor sharply. 

"Thank you, dear," said $Hero; "you're a generous girl," she bowed once more to the soldier, "and it will be of no use to you if I don't have the books in my other hand." 

The soldier was looking at $Hero at that moment, and he nodded sadly to his wife as she spoke. "You'll be a good mother," he said, "and take care and keep care of them well." He looked at $Hero with deep, kind eyes. "I am beginning to feel it!" he added softly. 

"Yes," said $Hero, "it is beginning to feel very good to have your books in your hand." 

The soldier was so pleased with his wife's words that he said, shaking his head, "It's an old trick, to use the new one. I should like to see what it is!" 

$Donor $Helper was now quite well on her way to the city, and her new book, in her hand he grasped a small dictionary and tried to sort out the best words to use. There he found a list of words for which there was no common sense explanation as, in $Hero's words, "explanatory, easy-going," "exciting," "absurd," "absurd," "unintelligible," "unreal," "unforgivable," "unimaginable," "what would an ordinary child say if he read these words?" $Hero's mind was racing furiously now and then. 

Again she looked at him. "What will you have to write in such an ordinary way?" she asked earnestly. 

"I've no idea," he said. However, she knew that

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
  If an honest man can be so pretty as to lie before $Villain, he shall be here, and shall sit in the Round Table with us.’ And when this was done, the Round Table was filled at length, and the $Villain sat himself down to the table, and said, ‘I cannot think that I have ever seen anyone so pretty as these two.’ Then the $Helper said, ‘Well, if you can lie below, you will make us feel good; and if you don't, we should be ashamed of you.’ Then he looked about him and laughed, and said, ‘Well, I am very pretty; I ought to like that.’ Then the $Helper said, ‘I can tell when I am fast asleep; I am asleep,’ and he sat down beside him, and looked very pretty. When they were sitting round the table, the first wanted fell at the $Helper’s head; and then both the Knights jumped up, and cried out to their master, ‘$Helper! come out and tell us what you are up at that corner.’ Then the $Helper replied, ‘I am lying in bed; I am dreaming; tell us now whether you are or are not dreaming.’ And the $Helper replied, ‘I can tell when my head is asleep: I can also when my head is awake: I can also tell when two persons are standing near me.’ To this question they replied, ‘Both of us are sleeping: wake up, come up, and tell us whether we are or are not dreaming.’ And when the $Helper woke up, they called him up, and said he was dreaming: they told him they did not think he was dreaming, but that his father was near, and could be heard to say something good news at the window. He jumped up, and taking the $Helper’s hand, led him away in a brisk rush; but he got away by climbing up a tree, and letting the sap fall on to his back, warmed his body, and made him feel quite light and lean. 

Just as he got to the tree he heard a clashing of hoofs, and on each side of him a loud noise sounded: the young $Helper saw the two men jumping up towards him, and could make out who was standing between them and what was going on. He came nearer and looked, and heard the same sound before he went in at the $Helper, who had run away for fear of his friend: when in a few moments more they had jumped up and jumped down upon him; and he fell on his knees before the window, and the two $MagicalObject of the $Helper fell on his back, and smeared his face with them. Then he stepped upon the bodies of the two and called to the $Helper, and he took them both prisoner, and gave each a bad-looking whipchet, and made them hang about his neck. At first they slept peacefully together, but, seeing that he could not take no rest, they struck a fit; and one of the Hook boys, who had just been caught in a witchcraft, jumped into the air, and whirled round as if to some purpose. As soon as he got near the spot where the boys lay, he flew away over $Place, but the first one pointed his whip at his head, and that startled him so much that he did not respond. As to the second, he called to him because he was not sure who it was; but even he could tell it was the $MagicalObject of Balibar. 

The wind blew so violently that the bodies of the two who were entangled in the whipchet would lie flat on the ground; but both of them lay on the ground and looked sad: so that one of them said something bad about $MagicalObject, and the other said “Ay, that’s a good one.” $Donor of Fortune was delighted to hear these two reciting this sad nonsense, and, turning round the corner, found the spot where Balibar lay. “You naughty boys,” he said, “till you are old, and perhaps you’ll find your trouble.” Then he took the $Helper by the hand and led her into the kitchen; and there they ate together, and laughed together, and were ever ready to dance and jig around each other. But something knocked at the door, and when they opened it, there $Placed the child before the $Villain as an accused person, and, being armed, he put an end to her wiles; and the next morning she went to sleep. Then he was quite sad, and did not know how to get out of bed, or if he could, when the sun went down, for he did not know how to get out

 at the windows. The boy had to do it, and in no time he was finished! The room was crowded with a hundred men in line. The children were not satisfied with this, however, until all the pirates had been paid, and two gentlemen from the merchant's merchant family showed up before the hall. And now, on to the next day, when the boys were all going over to see who could set the fastest $MagicalObject, a little $Helper appeared! 

$Donor boy was dressed like a $Hero, but he was armed with a great sword, and at close quarters with a club. Of course he jumped just like a cat and didn’t hurt anyone. 

In $Place, on the floor, there was a big book of pearls, and the children saw many of them. That they had to read their very first $MagicalObject they were not surprised, particularly when they saw that the magic was not merely on paper, but really on the $Place itself. 

"You ought to have read $MagicalObject," said $Villain, "and now you can read $MagicalObject yourself." 

And she looked in the middle of the room, and there stood the $MagicalObject of a woman. 

And the mother exclaimed, "Oh, who the devil would teach us to read on the little table! No, I’d better not go, because I’m tired of waiting for him to come. I can think of something a bit better to do." And, of course, her counsel was, "Jump on the big chair instead of the table!" 

Now, it was a great deal easier to jump off the table. And the $MagicalObject had been made very simple that way. 

The $MagicalObject was just like a great mirror. She knew what it was, as she saw it from top to bottom, and, of course, she knew what to do with it if she wanted to get a better look at her children. 

There were two $MagicalObject on either side of her. One was made of iron, the other of glass. 

When they were all alone, the $Villain said, "How can you be so foolish as to sit on the iron table and wait for the big man?" 

No, she answered, "You might as well hang a glass door open to let him in," for people always open doors when they want something. 

"But what can be done to solve your problem," the mother said, "when one is constantly bent, as people are?" 

"I don’t know," said the $Helper. 

"Well, if the glass is on your back, then don’t be afraid, just hold it up and let him in," said the $Helper, "and be sure, when you open it, that everyone in the room is dressed in their proper form." 

"I don’t think so," said the $Helper. 

"Don’t speak the thought of it to anyone," said the $Helper. 

$Hero and the others waited quietly until the man showed up. The door, of course, was opened to him, and when he showed up he was all alone. 

"What is your name?" asked the $Villain, when she had made the arrangements for turning the $Place into a house. 

"Naw! ha!" said $Hero suddenly. But she hadn’t said it to frighten $Donor in the first place. 

"Now where are you coming from?" she said. 

"From $Villain," said $Hero. 

"Oh, it’s fine," she said. "We want to know: has the $MagicalObject been there?" 

"No, I don’t know, but it’s quite strange." 

"Are they always coming?" 

"No, they are traveling the whole way to-day." 

"When did you come here?" 

"Before I was born." 

"And what did you learn about $MagicalObject?" 

"Oh, I learned about the $MagicalObject. At twelve my heart was torn in two, and I lost everything. After that I was saved again, but for some time I wasn’t saved. At last $Hero asked me for a share of the profit." 

"I can’t tell what it is," said $Hero. "I could not tell whether it was for your sake or for mine." 

"My dear," said the $Villain, "I have nothing to tell you; it is to tell you that I

 drawn from the window and out. Now it was the only opportunity for him to carry on his conversation. He was looking at the clock in the window by himself as he wrote this or that word of the clock. He couldn’t think of another moment. When he started his work and sat down and set the door frame open, he could hardly see the woman who had helped him, or the man who had dragged out the handle of the door-frame had dragged him back and forth to the house again. 

Now, there were two windows, one of which stood open, the other closed. The man had made his work some $Placed on the other, and when he had finished it, he had gone to find the woman in the window, and there was her work done. When it was all finished and the woman came in the front door, the man went back to the house and showed the woman the door, and the woman saw that it was painted very dark and bright pink, and she was quite frightfully frightened. Then she opened the door, and the man entered, and the woman took his hat and went up on her elbow; the man took the old mop and rolled it around his face and looked quite pleased that he was back again. Then he went out into the country, got some bread, and drove in a carpenter’s bench to make a few stools. 

He set the little white chair on the table, set the fire, and took the candles; then he put the soap-can and the wood-drill; it was of brass, so that they were very brittle; but they were all of brass, and he liked the pick and shovel so much that he said, "I shall take a pair with me, for it will always rust"; and it was very safe, he said, so he went in with the pick and shovel. As they came nearer nearer, and he could not help thinking that they could be strangers to him, he took the lamp from his pocket, and shone it till it shone out; and then he went into the kitchen and washed the dishes. 

Now, I know this is new to one, because you know I must tell you it must be a wonderful journey! All that was needed was a needle; iron, for the needle was set upon the table, and he laid down his work and was so tired that he was almost suffocated. 

When he had got to his room, the woman came in to see him; and she, too, was very frightened, and took the scissors and made a picture of the beautiful, clean woman, so that the man could see exactly where she cut the house, and the picture was made, and the woman was carried away to live. 

Then he and the woman went to the kitchen to light the fire, and when they lifted the pot, it was very hot, and as soon as the flames were extinguished, he saw the beautiful, clean woman wash the dishes and build the one room of the house, and when she came and had done, the other two rooms were painted pink at the top so that he could see very well where she had done all the beautiful stuff, and how beautifully she painted them and how well the room looked painted of that, too. So she swept the dishes, but not before she had swept the pots; and so it went on for many many hours: and the house was so much prettier than before, it was like a beautiful fairy’s house, he laughed and he joked, and every now and then he would tie a piece of string around our necks to get us to laugh and to run about about, and he liked to play the violin, and sing and do all sorts of odd things. One day he brought one violin in an old box for our enjoyment, and we had a merry time playing it, and one time one moment we were laughing just at the end, and one moment we were crying, and one moment we were all so merry! The thing is, the thing does never die, and this was just as it was once; and now one minute, it lives, and it lives forever! 

It got into his head that if we didn’t love the thing very much, then we didn’t like the things that were around it, and if the room was painted pink at the top, it was quite hard to see what was the end result, and how we were all so terribly confused and frightened. 

He began thinking again about the picture, and we should talk more and give him more ideas, and he ought to try more seriously what we could do with pictures and pictures of old. 

There once was a farmer who had a little girl, and when this was over, he said the same thing to his daughter that we all must talk about the same thing over and over again at school. He meant to make the child more acquainted

 dictionary, 'You are not going to be the right $Villain for a maiden, but your brother is going to marry your sister!' 

He looked at her, which was a sign she meant to sign! He looked at the wall, and the table, the table, the table, and she was holding it in both hands and holding it in both ears as though she was saying, 

'You have taken your oath!' His eyes went to the wall. His eyes went to her; she had put the table together. He was holding it in both hands and saying, 

'You have taken your oath!' And his tongue went into the ears of the young woman, and he was saying, 

'You have taken your oath?' and his mouth went out of the girl's mouth. 

She was not going to accept it! 

He must tell her something! He must tell her how he felt that day! 

And that was very soon all! He got up. He put on his new glasses, and $Placed himself on the right side of him; he raised his eyes to the table; he put on the clothes that belonged to him, and there stood right on his plate. And he ate like a gentleman. 

He saw a queer face coming into the centre of the table. A long long curly brown beard that was going to curl up into a whole heap. He saw little $Place of such a face in reality. There was a table there, a table, a table in which it was very very very very thin. He sat on his plates. He stood on his sides. 

He did not have to eat! How did he do? 

He went to the stove; he went to the fire. He went to the light. 

He put the dishes on the dish-table, and he went into the kitchen. 
 and at last found the house! He took good rest. He went to meet the $Villain, and look for a wife. And he met him! 

His father, his little wife, her little boy, there was only one thing that was the more extraordinary, a bird that could make one wish. 

The $Villain's wife was thinking of moving, and so she invited the young man to come with her to see all the beautiful landscapes and farms, he could not tell yet but that which was to be seen of everything. If he could not come with an invitation he was not allowed to stay. So they sent his cousin $Villain to seek for him, but he was too late. 

When he arrived, he was still clad in his best clothes. His father sat at the stove and said: 

'How did you get on this hot fire? I did not let you in.' 

'I stole the water, did you not!' said his father. 

'Oh, there you are!' 

'I did, do you see that bird lying dead beside it, and that bird being so alive and sound that I can say it cannot be helped! Do I hear how good my wife looks, with one large heart and a fair mouth!' 

'Oh, I hear!' said the young man. 'And she, do you hear the sound of the breathing of the water? Good! Now it will be just as easy as ever to see what a noble $Place that beautiful maiden is in; good for the whole world to behold what a beautiful $Villain that beautiful lady does by doing the best for one hundred, and for the whole of the earth. Good! Good!' 

And when the little man was about to speak with his cousin, he heard his name repeated over the hearth. 

'Dear aunt! How do you think you look, father?' 

'I,' answered his father, 'look splendid. I do not think they are that tall.' 

'Why, I'm glad they are,' said his uncle. 

'Oh! thank you, Aunt Mabel,' said his father, 'but they are no good without us. They are the little puddings that people make with their teeth.' 

$Donor ate his dinner and his drink and thought upon the many happy feelings that the little man had for all the earth. 

The $Villain and his cousin went out to seek for the lady. He went forth to seek her. 

But the $Villain was mighty careful. 

He said to the $Villain: 

''You are to seek for the lady of the wood in a cottage, and make her come to you, so that you may not harm and take no notice of her, nor shall you be bound by oath to guard her, neither shall anyone dare to take her in any way, nor try

 she had heard many stories about Mr. Lincoln. 

'Tell me one about his mother,' said the $Helper to the old woman. 

Mrs. Bradley looked at the old woman for a few minutes with doubt. Then she said: 

'Don't you know what she looks like?' 

'I've never seen anything quite like it,' said Mrs. Bradley. 

'What makes her so beautiful?' continued $Hero. 

'She lives with her mother in this farmhouse, right across the street from the Palace of Westminster.' 

$Hero nodded. 

'Of course her mother doesn't want her to have a child, so we will have a little of it. She has plenty of gold with her, and a lot of it in her pocket. She carries a bit worth a stone in her quilt. She goes into the Palace of Westminster when she is in bed to go to the ball, but it seems to be an enchanted ball, and $Hero doesn't like doing anything enchanted any more. Mrs. Bradley thinks she is a great $MagicalObject, though.' 

'Ah,' said $Hero at last, 'I've been told that there is an old lady in the palace who lives here with five servants, and the servants wear gowns made of gold and silver. They eat everything they see, and have two beds for them together. The first has a small dish of porridge, with a little butter in it which the kitchen ladies can quickly prepare for the maid's liking. The second has a pot of fine wine, which the servants have nothing to drink but, I fear, from their sweet stomachs.' 

'Ah!' said the $Helper. 'How lovely $Hero! I scarcely know what to say.' 

'She is beautiful,' said Mrs. Bradley. 

'No, I'm not, but I'll bet if I put her back in the palace I should be glad.' 

'Yes,' said $Hero, 'she's beautiful. My mother is fond of her in the house, and she would love to have her back.' 

'I am fond of her,' said the $Helper; 'and now it's not fair for her to leave me! You see, $Hero, it will soon be grown-up time for me to go home, and to be back.' 

Mrs. Bradley looked at $Hero. 

'Oh, you will be going over by Sunday, and I will be late.' 

'Not long. You have certainly got my feeling,' said the door. 'But if you can't come over for a little while, it will get busy with my work.' 

'Not really a little crowded in the Palace of Westminster, by the way.' 

'I have a lot of money to buy a castle for $Hero, too, and a good old house to take in; we can do that.' 

'Yes, Mrs. Bradley, I agree with the plan. You mustn't mind that your hand might be slipping away.' 

'You don't see how many people come,' said Mrs. Bradley; 'I'll never touch a thing about it.' 

'We'll get her to think about it. $Hero, we want to get our own $Hero.' 

The old lady looked at $Hero. 

'She is old and dejected,' she said suddenly. 'She says she is tired of waiting for me to call and have tea. It'll be a long wait.' 

'I shall come over soon,' said $Hero, as she set up another question. She was shaking her thin fingers. 

The $Helper nodded her head. 

'But this will be too long a wait! There are only so many dates the $MagicalObject can be fixed on.' 

'You would never hear yourself described as such before, Mr. Stevenson. You are a happy man. You have given us so many little good laughs.' 

'I have had the good laughs,' admitted $Hero. 

'And now it comes to $Hero,' said the $Helper. 'She will not go back yet,' she added, in a tone very friendly. 'I have long been anxious to see her again, and it has cost me time to look after the house.' 

She stood up straight and looked at the ground, with an eager look of hope at Mrs. Bradley. 'It will cost, dear, dear to keep the house for Mrs. Bradley?' 

'It will,' said Mrs. Bradley. 'And $Hero is so new to a house, I would give a whole month to see her!' 

'You are not the right wife, Mrs. Bradley,' said $Hero. '

 another to the table and $MagicalObject. “You may now be satisfied,” said the $Helper, as he sat on his throne. “Are you satisfied? You were not told that it had been the $MagicalObject until this morning.” “You have been to all the $MagicalObjects? I am happy to hear that all of them seem to be happy.” And the $MagicalObject said, “$MagicalObject, that we will find a way to set you free. But that is not the way. Yours is an invisible fire, so keep the fire burning.” Upon saying these words the $MagicalObject disappeared. 

Now a peasant woman once went into a forest and sought shelter in a hollow tree. All around her was a hollow tree, and when she came out and looked closely under the hollow tree, she saw an old woman with a wooden plank in her side. She knew the woman, and said to her: 

“The $MagicalObject did not come. He has long been gone.” 

Once upon a time there lived a $Villain long before the storm and the witch, who had twelve daughters, with a $MagicalObject of gold. They shared the common fortune, but when one of her daughters had a stroke of misfortune a thousand stones fell down over her, and the little one, whom one of her daughters loved, fell a thousand miles away. No sooner did an enchanted maiden descend into one of the enchanted lands than one song of lamentation sang, 'The $Villain did not hear, and fell on hard times.' In another moment the $Villain's twelve daughters, with a $MagicalObject of gold, were transformed into snakes, and in the evil land descended the wickedest of snakes, who gave birth to a thousand beautiful children, twelve daughters of twelve, seven months long, and who were destined to bear the heavy burden of the twelve years. But one of them, twelve years old, fell into a valley where all the animals seemed to take their winter quarters, and died in the valley. One of the twelve $Heroes, a swan, was wont to fly across the desert to her sister the $Villain’s twelve brothers, to make a vent. 

A $Villain once came to a mountain, where there was a court filled with horses. Two $MagicalObject sat on the pinnacle of a ladder which he had built for himself one thousand seven hundred thousand, and on each end were mounted a horse that was the strongest horse in the world. One of the $Heroes was so heavy on one foot that she could not lift it and could only gallop fast at one end. Her brothers held fast to their feet, so that they might not strike one another. One of them was so heavy that she could not hold a hoe, and could only hitch a hoof, and when the other horse could do it, he refused to do it. Then came another horse who could even hoe herself no farther. But the second horse was not tired, but was only thinking all night. 

When at last a third was caught up with the others, with twelve horses and a ladder on each hoof, her brothers called at her and said: ‘Now, one last request. Set me on the ladder and ride on.’ She was tired at last, and they, with their torches, sat on the steps of the house. So she went to the head of the ladder, got on, and off she went came a carriage, and on the back was a great hall filled with chairs, and all of them with torches and benches. Suddenly a voice cried from the front, ‘Let this servant off from his master! Set him on the ladder and wait here until I light my torch.’ ‘Do you know who I am?’ said the horse, and he walked on toward the door of the hall. As he approached, a little voice cried: ‘Let man off from his body.’ And on the other side a great noise came from the door, and the carriage stopped. When the horses came in, the voice cried: ‘Let man off from his carriage.’ The carriage rode on until it came to a corner, so that, behind it, four horses were mounted, and there sat a man who had long legs, long dark hair, and a red cap on his head, and was dressed in a silken kerchief, and a gold crown. ‘How can anyone be allowed to ride on my body?’ said the horse, and he took the ladder on which the servant was sitting, and the servant lifted him up. And as they looked about him, they saw who he really was, and they said to him: ‘That is one fine year for us!’ And he said:

 the table. 

'I shall be happy to-morrow but not happy as long as I live; but then I must know what love is, or there shall be no marriage.' 

But there it was. The moment of her gratification took no care of. There was only a moment or two in which she drew no breath and put on her coat-sleeves and went to sleep; at last, with her eyes shut, she opened them and lay down again on the floor. 

The poor thing, seeing to herself, could not take care of herself, therefore thinking her to be an able and lucky child, laid her down without a word, and left the $Place. The maid came in the dark; the $MagicalObject carried a great lantern in his pocket. To his immense surprise, the lantern heard all that the lantern-beard had said, and saw that the roses on the table were of purebred $Heroes and the apples of a very different $MagicalObject were of purebred $Heroes, and the cakes of a different $MagicalObject were of purebred $Heroes, and this was so with a perfect stranger. And with him, too, was surprised with the roses and apples on the table, and the $MagicalObject, seeing them, went on with his dinner. 

After a long day's hard work he was tired and very hungry. At last he sat down beneath the table and the $MagicalObject looked at him with curiosity. So thoughtful and so full of energy did he feel, that he said, 'Thou art wise to care, O my lord and savior!' 

Then the great lantern came flying up and sat down on the roof of the great palace. 

The master of the carriage set up a light which he set on the chimney, so that it could burn no brighter than it liked; but the lantern flew higher and higher, and on the roof hung a white flag. The master of the carriage was amazed, and he was very much discouraged. 

It was of gold, and of jewels, and of fine clothes, and he really thought all that mattered. He put on his mastercoat and went out on the balcony to look about him. It was quite dark beneath him, and in the darkness he could see no one, but at a little distance still below he caught sight of $Hero's face. 

'See there, dear son!' cried she, crying out sweetly. 'Thou art my dear son, thou who is with me over the mountains and seas, thou wilt see much of my love come to pass, and never let me leave the palace.' 

$Hero took his own precious word very carefully, which was of such importance that no one can possibly express it in words save thou, nor any one else. It was of no use in telling his trouble; he must try to feel her hand in the agreement and to set it to his own. He was a terrible man. 

The moon shone brightly, and the candles which burned in the royal porch were as red as blood, so brighter than ever in a year! One could not help thinking they would look pretty in the star-light. 

The door was locked, and nobody dared open it. There was no door in sight, but there was an old fairy in the hall coming back from her journey, and telling a story which would make $Hero some $Place to put her heart into it. 

'$Hero,' she said, 'here is a young man I have never heard of before; he is with a $Villain I saw him in a dream, I had a wish to see him for the first time, I flew up into the sky, and behold him I saw a bird with wings that were as red as blood, and with a shining crown that wove to it so fine an apple, that I scarcely could get my eyes away from it. He laid it on the ground for a while, and when the sun shone it glowed so brightly, that when the moon shone it shone so brightly and made me look at it I could not keep still, and soon I had seen the crown, and saw the $Helper, but I could not help thinking 'thou art the $Villain of that beautiful apple as well as my father $Hero!' 

$Hero lay on the ground, with her hand on her eyes. 

'O, my $Hero, my darling!' she whispered in $Hero's ear. 

Then she flew up into the sky and looked out upon the sunbeams, and $Hero saw her father and mother. She sat on the ground, and looked very lonely. 

'I was dreaming when he laid the apple on the ground ' she faltered and shook her head, 'nothing ever happens that I can't explain! But if my father was

 that all had a chance to laugh at her. She said nothing about it. 

'No-one has done anything foolish,' came the sound of jeering voices. 'It is only the children who get so terribly ticked up after seeing a bit of fun or laughter every now and then.' 

She called the one who knew the matter to look politely away. 

'Is that the reason?' asked the woman at once, as she tried to get a good look at her mother. 

'For nothing but that,' answered the mother. 'So you must not think that a bit of silly grandstanding will help you.' 

'Not really,' declared the child. 

'You are a good baby,' spoke the mother. 'I will keep you if I am really sorry for my rudeness.' 

'I am not,' returned the child, 'and what shall I do now?' 

'I will go to my mother, and try to get her to listen to the story. I would be all right, if I had patience. I have not been trying to-night. When the clock struck twelve, I went down to the river, and I knew I should get up. It was a cold night's night. And there was a storm in the boat, and it was hard to get in. But all at once, I knew I could get out, and it was a hard night's night.' 

She was silent. 

'When the clock struck the hour of twelve, I went down to the river.' 

'To listen to the story. I wanted to get the old woman to listen to it; but we did not know what was in it, and all we knew was that it was sad. I should think I must have made a wrong use of the time. If only that time had been of use.' 

'I must have put my knapsack on.' 

The children looked at her. Her voice was firm and easy. 'Of course it was sad,' she said; but yet she spoke with a little tremor of mind that the story might help her get up. 

It was a long, hard evening. The wind beat against the tree tops, and the branches wagged. The sea shook. The clouds rolled before her. At last, as she stood leaning against the soft soft shore, a little soft breeze blew with a gentle humming. 

'I must go to the bed,' she said. 'I hope it is already dawn.' 

'When the clock strikes twelve,' said the woman, 'I go down to the river. But where am I to take cold?' 

She stopped a moment, as it seemed to her that the wind might be of help. Then she said: 

'It is winter, and we do not like the cold. If we were all of us again, you and I: You and I would sleep in a tree. If it was a lady-bird like that in the forest, I should be very glad.' 

'It would be a lovely thing!' 

'Would it be?' asked the woman. Then, her voice quiet, she said again 'If it was a lady-bird, please tell us. The bird has told me he would like you.' 

Again the woman spoke without question. 'You would take the bird again.' And once more she spoke with a little tremor of mind, that the story might help her get up. 

Of course it was impossible for herself, she really thought, to get the warm day air to get enough of the warm nights. Her face was hard and her eyes were very thin, too; so the simple man asked whether he might do something for her, just for a time. The woman said he would not try to comfort her, but she would get up again; and while he was off she would take her hand-bags, but that she was very tired at the office. It would be very silly not to try to comfort her, to do as the man asked of herself. She looked at him, and then, with a little sigh, took her friend with her and went away with a good friend. 

'A-a-and a-d,' said she, 'and my husband's name is Bill, on the back of a little card. He gave it to me so that I could carry it off. We are both beautiful, and it's a pity that so little ought to get something so worthless in return. We ought to give the little fellow something so ugly to hold his cards.' She took her little bag and went in her little cot and put them away. 

'Do give it to me,' thought the woman, 'and I will remember it to-morrow. You are such a good husband and a good wife

 tell the little soldier what he meant by such a meeting, and the little Soldier took his saber and cut open the great dragon of the $Villain’s wall. The dragon flew away as if it had broken through a pane of glass, and the Soldier sat down once more in peace, while his saber was of precious silver and the dragon was standing still a moment. Then the little Soldier carried his saber home to the old Soldier. 

"You are welcome," said the old Soldier, "and it is good to be rid of my little enemy again. But you are more than welcome in my house; after all, they are good people. They know what can be done." 

As soon as the two travelers lived together, the $Villain took one of the Snow $Villain’s great castles, and his daughter took the Kingdom with it. But they did not set eyes on each other long, for they knew each other because before long they had heard the Snow $Villain’s boast, that she could not bear to live in this large, empty castle. Now, when Snow $Villain’s wife first saw the $Villain, she was so frightened that she called loudly for the $Villain to be changed; but the $Villain would not believe it, and after that he called the Snow $Villain’s wife as before, and had it written in $MagicalObject, that the $Villain was at the door. 

When the soldier and the young child met there, it was not in the church where the $Villain had left off, that the $Villain spoke so freely; but beneath the church stood a little apple that had never had a proper name, and which the young $Villain had not wanted to wear for three years. The old $Villain was very jealous of the apple; for the little boy often put the apple to his lips to see if it would help him in some way. At the sight of the $Villain’s boast, the soldier was very angry, for the $Villain wished that he were gone, and that he was to have lost his eyesight. He called him a coward, and threatened that he would beat the $Villain down to the ground. But the $Villain would not listen to the bluff; he did not care whether he were alive or dead; he knew that the traitor Snow $Villain was lying in wait, and would not be helped. Then he told him the whole story; and the soldier was forced to listen to it all; and when the $Villain heard the story, he was horrified. He began to weep, and tried to think of nothing better to do than to make himself happy; but he could not get the tears out of his eyes. He went out to the wood, and sought shelter under a tree which grew in the forest. There he saw a little cottage where a great many lived in it. He walked up and down on the street, and saw two young men sitting outside. ‘What are you talking about?’ asked one of them. ‘We can eat and drink from here,’ said the other. Then the soldier said: ‘If you will allow us, we will become invisible around the invisible man, so long as he is invisible, and that will make him a lot more easy to spot.’ Then a third said: ‘That seems to me a lot more likely than an invisible man to be alive,’ and they left the house: the invisible soldier sat in the cottage, looking pretty much everywhere; he never looked around or looked around without looking invisible. The soldier said nothing, and felt sorry for the little things he had lost. 

He went on his way, and being weary, ate nothing but berries and figs, and slept. In the morning he came to a large spring, where a great many ducks were swimming about. One of them was so large that he could not even lift his head to look at it, and the poor duck cried out: ‘Little one, little one!’ But the others, being busy at home, said: ‘Nothing shall come between now and noon, we are not at home.’ 

The soldier went on, and being weary, ate nothing but berries and figs and poultry, and went on looking for a way to get out of the spring. And being very hungry, he came to a large corn-field. There sat a few millers who had all been out working, and there every day were laying away corn. To-day there were seven or eight men lying down, but they were all asleep. The soldier reached down and wanted to eat something, but his mouth was so cold that he swallowed so many gums and lumps of grain that he was forced to let go. When he got to the corn, he saw the soldiers

 and he began to cry, for, as it was evening, his mother came and said to him: 

“I have just one little daughter, whose name is Snowdrop, and she is just as smart as any of all the rest. She says I have $MagicalObject, and that I can cast a spell on her. As soon as you go out by yourself and by yourself you become really stupid.” 

The child was quite frightened, and said: 

“Oh, you wicked little thing, they are really no more wicked than we thought, and we can cast a spell over you at your leisure.” 

When the child left her fairy master, however, she went herself out to fetch a bottle of water that the door might easily be opened. There she found the bottle, and poured forth her milk and honey. The child at once was frightened, but she kept on till the old old woman appeared and asked again what she had brought. 

“I brought,” said she, “a hundred and fifty gold coins. Had I brought them by myself they would of course have perished in the tempest, but as they are all changed, so you must have paid tribute to them.” 

“Who gave you these fifty gold coins?” 

“Who gave the coins you called coins?” said the witch. 

“Oh, it's because you are stupid. I don't like the look of your twenty dollar bills. They are all made of marble.” 

“Are they marble? Then they must always be $MagicalObject.” 

“Yes, that's true,” said the witch. “They are $MagicalObject all the same. However, to keep you from calling them $MagicalObject you must make them new.” 

“I wish you would make them all change colors,” answered the witch. “To make a new coat they must also change their hair.” 

“That is ridiculous!” said the boy. “That only makes one $MagicalObject change their hair.” And he said to the girl: 

“If you come and make each change his color; if you do nothing then everything will be black.” 

The $Villain then asked how she would fare. “Make each of you a new coat,” she said, “and I will make each of you a new handkerchief; your hair must be made of gold.” 

“All right then,” said the witch, “go back to your children and tell me where the $Hero is.” 

Then all the children all played, and $Hero said: 

“Tell me, how do I bring you there?” 

“I'll tell the old Witch about $Hero and the new $Hero to please her.” 

“Now, give each of you the finger or claw, and go into the kitchen and fill the pan. When the time comes I will look up and you must follow me, and when I finish you must put the cat down, but be careful, for he will throw up your $MagicalObject and that will be your fault.” 

So the cat was killed, but Snowdrop went with her and $Hero and $Donor, and they followed $MagicalObject to the $MagicalObject. Then they all went out again as usual, and at midday it came to the $Villain, and he gave each one a ring and said, “Here is my prize!” So all the $MagicalObjects went home and each took their prize for the $Villain. 

Then the following evening the $Villain and the $Villain got together, and Snowdrop and $Hero went to the pot of water at the table, and the youngest had Snowdrop put away to be taken back to her own Kingdom. When the $Villain was gone, he left no one. But he made it known in all his people, so that no one said that he was dead. The next day the old $Villain said: “I will bring you to me as a gift.” So he put away the cat. It did not hurt him at all. But if he had put one of the little cats back into the kitchen, there would have been a chance of catching the gold. So when the $Villain’s daughter came home, he said: “Give me the cat at once,” and she did, and when the $Villain went and fetched the gift she gave him the finger long enough to begin to count

 nobody, but he could not see it. Then the two pirates came up behind him and were quite furious, and he cried, ‘The best means of protecting me, I give you, is to go to the moon, where you can see the sight before you.’ Then they turned and were gone a moment. 

Then they said, ‘We can’t leave the moon soon.’ They brought four oxen, and they forced the eldest $Villain of that land to carry four oxen. 

That was a brave and unexpected treatment from the devil, who was also very angry as you may fancy, as long as he could only get the youngest $Villain to carry the oxen without asking her consent. 

Then the fox took hold of them and said, ‘You can cross the threshold and do well; but it would be a shame to the poor little animal, to carry food for him.’ Hans begged, but she answered, ‘If I can’t’t die, I can’t cease from it.’ 

Then the fox said, ‘It seems to me that each beast has a human part, so ask the bear of the hen-farmer’s herd.’ Hans went straight to the bear’s sheep, and there he met the bear. ‘What’s the matter with you?’ ‘I’m going down the stream to ask the hare to do me a favour.’ ‘No,’ said the bear angrily. ‘I don’t care for your trilling or begging; I’m going down the stream with my oxen at this rate.’ Hans did not give in, but thought it would be quite acceptable. The bear sat down next to him, made him shiver with pain, and fell on his knees before him. Hans stood like a sad knight above, and was almost asleep when he heard Hans speak. ‘Oh, Hans, I’m off!’ he said. ‘I’d rather get dirty with my hare, if that’s all that’s going upon me.’ ‘What’s your business here?’ ‘Mine is to search for the fox’s hide.’ ‘Ah,’ answered Hans, ‘that’s a poor man who lives underground. I’m going down with him, and if you don’t mind having my hare for my dinner, I’ll soon catch him.’ ‘Good-night, Hans,’ said the two foxes left him behind. 

A week after, Hans went back to the forest alone. Everything was in a condition to his tastes, and when he had made up his mind to go down again, he found that it was very cold very snowy day. So in his despair he shut the large window and slept soundly. On the following day the second daughter opened the large window and took a deep breath, as though she had suddenly fallen asleep. Then she opened the window to take in a new air, and a little mouse with white fur met her. Hans, very fond of their good friendship, opened the window and welcomed them into his mother’s presence. Hans told his mother everything that had happened the day the second daughter had first met her twin. Then he led them into the forest and had said, ‘We’ve met our match, and he seems to be very courteous.’ ‘Wife,’ he said, ‘what’s the matter with your twin? Do you want to be burnt at the stake?’ ‘Oh, no,’ answered Hans, ‘I don’t believe they can be saved, and if I were you, I could at any rate have them but they didn’t seem to care.’ ‘What should we do?’ said the wife. ‘We ought to get rid of our enemy first,’ ‘but Hans said he was going to fetch the fox, and if she didn’t come back with him I’d best go and rescue her.’ ‘It seems as if you don’t want to do it,’ answered Hans, ‘but you can still ask us where the fox lies.’ Hans sent his scouts along with his fox and his horse to the forest. When they arrived, they found a $Place in which the fox and his horse had already been captured. With this they set off at once, and they began searching for the fox in the forest, until at last they reached their goal. When they arrived at the fox’s hiding-$Place, Hans tied the horse to his tail,

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
That went on for some time. One day the youngest son came and told his father. But the other two boys said, “It’s our little sledge, and they’re sorry if you lost it.” Then they all went out together with their sledge, and the little sledge fell into the water, and it sank back into the water again. Then the eldest son said, “It didn’t matter much what happened,” and he took the sledge and rode home. 

Once upon a time there was a $Villain who had three sons and one daughter. They were all honest and industrious children, who worked night and day for the $Villain’s court, and in turn paid their wages, for that is the only good thing in the world. But they had something different to earn: oxen. One day, as the two older brothers were out chopping wood together in the forest, the youngest slipped aside a leaf of the leaf, and as the oxen rained plump meat from the ceiling, the two older brothers had to pull it out before it could be used. The two older brothers would then be called morons, and they would be called sharp oxen. They were so greedy that they could not find any meat on which to tie the oxen; so they had to tie them too tightly. Finally, the oldest brother would tie the oxen together with rope and beat one of the branches to death, and, when the $Hero had to return the rope, she was likewise put to work one time to tie it together again. And when the oxen ran the whole day without having run a branch, they became sad, and the $Hero could not speak to them, but she said she was not sure their sadism should be called out in this way; so she said the oxen must be let run, because at any rate the poor brothers would tear each other in soot. 

It happened that all these people who were rich and famous lived happily together, and had plenty to eat and to drink. 

A farmer once stood in the fields, and out of the corn grew a plant; and as he saw the name “Plant” written on it on the leaf of the plant, he wanted to know what it meant. So he asked the farmer, and they agreed that “Plant belongs to the farmer,” and he planted the plant. Soon afterwards the farmer became angry at this, but said that it wasn’t right in his eyes. “It’s not right,” he said. So the plant was given name “Plantainige.” So when the plant grew too big, “it’s no longer good for you.” Then the farmer decided to stop growing the plant, and he cut his beard with it. At first the farmer thought it was just a beard, and he kept doing it, but the beard became tattered and wrinkled, and the farmer thought it looked as if the beard had been cut off. Finally, the farmer thought the beard was his own and wanted to take it away, and he cut off all its hair. When he tried to look around him, his beard looked like it was hanging up on something that was hanging from the roof of the house. The farmer had to look round him and say, “That’s a bluff!” 

A farmer stood in the fields one day, and out of the straw he caught a goose. “Hey, goose,” he says, “Where are you hanging up your hair?” “On the roof! Out the window,” says the goose, and the farmer hangs up his hair again. 

When the farmer saw those first two rows of hair on the goose, he became furious, and accused the other farmers of stealing it out of his own beard and making fun of him. The farmers complained, but the farmer said, “I’m not a thief. My beard is hanging on a tree. There’s no use asking me to hang up my hair. I’ll hang up my beard as long as it takes.” His beard was then pulled right up into the farmer’s beard, and he said, “That’s not a trifle. You’ve got me hanging up my hair as long as you like.” “Fine, fine! That’s the way I’ll hang up my hair.” He hung it up so quickly, the goose looked up and said, “That’s just what I’d do if I became thieves, eh?” So they hung it up again. Now the farmer was furious, and he asked the other farmers if they still thought it’d be a good idea

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 setting me some soup, and then there was soup again. However, it was not really soup, for it was a little $MagicalObject. So I went to the kitchen. It was on a plate out of the corner of my eye, and I just sat there in it, as if I was going to eat a piece of bread. After the soup I took a look at my watch. It was at twelve o'clock on a late-afternoon break. 

I had seen a lot of ladies on break. Many had been walking at that time, they were called $Villainesses or Stadums. 

At the time I saw them I was no warrior, but a bit of $MagicalObject. I gave them a quick lick, and they let me run down to where the soup was made. Then I put a little iron cap on. 

Presently I put the watch back on, and $Placed it in my pocket. So I ran upstairs to the room and tried to wake my wife. Well, she ran out the door, but I kept on. 

I got up and ran till I found my wife at the window. We all lay there very still, and her face covered with wrinkles. 

'Get ready for bed!' I called, and the window was opened, her face turned up into heaven. The sun began to set, and we stood in the bright sunshine. 

'$Villain,' I called, 'what are you looking at here, mamma?' 

She looked back at me sadly, and I thought I understood. 'Oh, mamma isn't it lovely to be out here, running around with my watch under her arm?' she said. 

'I'm so glad I am,' I said. 

They both ran up to me, and I stood looking at them. 'Why, it is a beautiful sight,' said $MagicalObject. 'She runs in like an angel, waving her arms about like $Villain of the $MagicalObjects.' 

$Helper started to run as fast as he could into the house, but he was too terrified to see the beautiful woman. 

'Run! run for your horse, or give her a beating! But she ran in,' said Kitty. 

'Run for your $MagicalObject!' I shouted savagely. 'Run for your dear $MagicalObject.' 

After Kitty got up, she said to me, 'Did you see this beautiful scene here, $Helper?' 

I was surprised, of course. I knew the $Villain of the $MagicalObjects had so many beautiful women, and I wondered at the strange looks he gave to them. But it was clear we were looking for a $Place to hide. 

$Helper gave Kitty a kick in the leg. He gave a kick in the ribs, and a kick in the stomach, and a kick in the legs, and many a kick fall into the earth. There was the most amazing confusion, for we could see only one fall, and it was after that the girls rushed toward it and all the boys ran together. 

$Donor had been standing still and looking at everybody, while $Donor began to kick. And you remember as we were going on there was a tremendous roar and thump! at the end of the roar and the loud noise was so great $Donor let the broom fall from her broom and rolled away again. 

Well, the other girls got the better of the giants, and rushed in. Of course they ran, because it was the last time they had to catch a great, big owl, and they had a broom and ran like crazy together. 

$Donor was the most happy girl. She was so proud of what she had, that she had a garden-paper-sleeve and a $MagicalObject, not to speak of diamonds and rubies. 

'You can't look at me better!' said the owl. 'I can't even look at myself!' 

$Helper was a good deal frightened, but she looked at everything, and the most frightful thing was, that the bird flew away into the air so quickly! 

'I'll try!' said the owl, jumping up and hopping off at once. 'Can't I fly just as fast as I want to?' 

$Helper was all fright and stuff, that she could not spell  because it was so difficult to remember everything, and she tried so hard, and the owl flew just as fast as it flew, but she was frightfully afraid of it, for she saw it flying through the air and not at it. 

'We must get off, $Helper,' said the old woman, 'or they'll sting us so horribly.'

, a great black cloud of dust, and a tremendous roar of trumpets was heard over the country. Suddenly $Hero looked around, and saw seven-­colored girls running around on all sides, except in the west where they were holding a procession. Then she ran up to them and said in a mournful tone, “What is it? A procession for a beautiful lady? Have you got anything to do here?” but nobody heard or said anything. Then she returned with a little girl, and they all disappeared over the lawn in a great hurry. 

$Hero lost her little sister a long time ago, and she is a dear little thing to $Helper, who has loved her with all he can. As long as she lives in this strange land, $Donor will continue to torment him, till he changes into a giant bear, who will devour all one hundred of us. $Helper sees through all this, and says he has the strength of forty, and we are all to blame. 

$Hero was a happy little girl, and her mother was a fine, good-­looking old woman. She was also pretty, though she looked rather small and slender. 

“She is very brave, indeed!” $Helper said. 

“Oh, not so much.” she answered, quite pleased. “She comes in an old coat made for a woman. My mother doesn’t know how to sew, and she never seems to be able to sew once. Oh, and $Donor has a fierce smell, so that the $Donor knows her scent, and has never been able to prevent me, for all her goodness there have been many people all around, but no one has killed her.” 

She and all the little children came to a big oak-­heap and dug a grave out of it. Then they dug a grave out of the dirt and filled it with earth, and $Helper and $Hero built the house. 

“Here is the fire, $Hero!” she said as soon as they finished making it and then went to her sewing. “I am going to the church, too, you shall be a faithful Christian, and you shall tell the doctor what lies within, and I shall give him thy medicine, or else I will kill him.” 

“I shall do that!” $Helper cried, remembering her word. “Of course!” They went to the house, but $Hero stood outside and rang the house-­supply. The house-­supply ran out. They ran everything, but it still was a heavy load. $Helper and $Hero were terribly angry. “Oh, the doctor has to go.” 

“But I shall tell him where we are.” They told him, and it was all so well they knew it, and the doctor wouldn’t stop talking. 

“Then $Helper has it, and $Hero has to tell him.” So $Helper had it! All was to be revealed in a moment. The doctor kept awake, he knew, for two reasons. One, it was a dreadful sight. Two, it was to be a secret, quite unexpected and dreadful; and it was all now at once a crowd, a whole congregation of people, who had been waiting to hear it all. 

“The doctor,” $Hero cried, “he shall tell the doctor what he shall do.” 

“That he shall have the louse,” said $Helper. “He shall have the louse, or perhaps he shall have louse louse!” “But I wish they hadn’t to louse!” $Helper was just crying when she thought herself beaten. 

“He shall have the louse,” begged $Donor. “He shall have the louse!” 

“But I wish I hadn’t to louse!” $Donor felt she should have done just so. “They’re all children!” 

“You shall have the louse!” $Helper said. 

“But I wish that I hadn’t!” $Donor was still holding her breath. 

“Then I would have the louse!” $Helper meant the word in a brave way. “But I wish I hadn’t to have the louse!” And she laughed. “So I should!” 

“$Donor!” 

This was a terrible idea, but it made no difference, but $Helper soon came down on her knees with a heavy

 can be sure I wouldn't hurt the bird’s throat. I do have the knife and can cut off the heart. But if they want to get this fancy girl, they better go get it. And when the child comes out and is dressed in the daylight, I won’t touch it.” So they carried the boy outdoors, and when it was daylight, they got out, took the knife, and cut off the $MagicalObject, because the girl wanted to get the child to sleep. “Now that he’s awake, the $Villain’s soldiers will be able to see the bird easily,” said her mother. “We’ll keep watch for him until he’s seen us.” So they sent for the $Villain. “The $Villain’s soldiers must march faster than ours. We’ll take care for him and watch the forest closely.” And his adjutant, who had heard everything, was appointed $Villain who would march faster than ours. “Well, we’ll have to watch the forest closely,” said the $Villain. “Then the wights will keep watch.” And the wights ordered two scouts to be sent out, and soon they saw the $Villain in the daylight. And then they went to see what the fierce beast would do, but it was hard to see how he could hurt a human being. Then in a little while they all returned in great rejoicing and blessing to the old mother, and her son went out to the forest, where he found the fierce beast there charging at him. “Bust him,” cried the $Villain, “and I’ll charge headlong into the fray.” The $Villain was terrified, and roared so loudly that the animal became frightened, and when he tried to bite off some of his own horn, he couldn’t bite himself off. Then the beast roared again, and the $Villain sprang into a corner and ran after him. But the $Villain jumped out of the bushes and tried to catch the $Villain, but the $Villain jumped out of the fire, so the $Villain caught himself, and he caught the $Villain in the midst of the beast. Now this same evening the $Villain ate what the $Villain had eaten and went home to his wife for the third time. “Well, it makes me feel good to be able to do this when I’m asleep,” said the $Villain. “Then I’ll also like to see how my son is doing.” The $Villain thought, “I’ve eaten enough.” So he called the daughter and the wife who were with him, and when the daughter heard the voice of the $Villain, she recognized it as her own. Immediately she ran to the kitchen, where the $Villain had given her his daughter. Then she gave the young man a sleeping potion and took him home and his wife. The next morning the $Villain thought about all the terrible things she had said and told her to kill her son because his heart should have remained in her. The youth was to begin living in a cave and crawl through the earth until he reached a height where all the grass was cut thick and dense. Then he would creep out and eat all the earth from below with one bite. Soon he grew so large that he fell close to the brink, became a thousand million-­kilometre journey, and left the land. His wife had to go to him each day, and he never returned. Since she didn’t know how he managed to fall so far, she stayed away and was really sorry. Since they talked too much, she became very sad, and the tears began to fall. When they reached a height she was sorry that she had missed him. She was then able to go home and not only thanked God, but also thought She was quite sad because she had killed the $Villain. She called the wife and called the children. “Where’s your son?” they asked. “He came to a certain hill, and when he fell he spilled all the blood.” So she said, “I’ll give him a small piece of my heart as a birthday present. If he’s lucky, I’ll also give him a tiny piece.” And so she gave him a small piece of his heart that would make anyone who saw it. Afterward she went to the hill and looked behind her. It seemed to her that there was a $Place where a little fellow, called Thumbelina, could talk. She wanted Thumbelina to know how she got to the spot and was to call her again. But Thumbelina didn

 “You are a rich man? You could very easily sit in my hotel here in South Kensington Square.” 

“Why should I?” said the $Villain. “If you sit in my hotel without permission, you will be taken to the fire, and you, my children, will be put to bed.” And she left them an impression: she was a poor old woman, who never got any sleep, and who did everything in her power to make her sleep. 

“Then why are you here? It is just as if someone were to ask me why I left you behind?” 

“You are welcome to come and stay here, and if it is quiet and quiet it will be really wonderful, and if it is crowded, I shall do my best to do many things well. If I am to eat or sleep, I shall have to do all sorts of things. In this way my servants will know me, and my servants, on my orders, will bring you into perfect order and pleasant company. Also you are to have a room at my palace.” 

“That is a good request,” said the servant. “But how can you come here quietly and quietly? I don't know what makes me want to enter.” 

“You are foolish and want something to frighten you.” 

“My servants will certainly help you to that. I can't help it as well as you do. But if someone asks me why I left you behind, I shall answer that you were an excellent man and that you came by my advice because you followed the rules.” 

“You are such a good child!” said the $Villain. “Now, just go into my room and “drink as much tea as you please.” 

“I must go,” said the servant, “to get some breakfast for me.” When she reached her bedside, the servants bade her good-by, and took her thither once more. 

“Good-bye, $Villain!” said the sunbeams. His majesty sprang to his aid. He was tired, and looked as if he had seen something extraordinary happen, and he turned to leave. 

When the sunbeams were behind him, there came together a great company waiting for him, who seemed to grow faint of heart. 

“O you sun-god of the forest,” said the $Villain, “this does not seem like a very good time for going to the fair. The trees which my children are going to eat are gone or have fallen, and their branches are all hanging down. They must be getting ready to eat something, or else they shall have to tear their young ones to pieces.” 

“Oh! but if they don't tear their young one to pieces, what a dreadful fate they must be in!” 

Then the $Villain departed, quite distressed that so many $Princes had come thus far, and presently lost all hope of making the journey again he sent messengers to all the people who had come to ask him for help. 

“Let us go,” said the $Hero, and she let the messengers go as they wished. But all these came hurrying up to the $Hero, and the sunbeams said, “We would rather die than have you wait this whole day.” 

“You may wait a long time!” said the $Hero. So she went home to her mother. $Donor had just come out of her window, and he was looking quite happily at the $Hero.  $Donor was the one on the mast, and had put on all her coat and hat, and looked as happy as could be, while the other two were looking at their master and his three sons. They were astonished at this change of face, and wondered at the sorrow they were under and how they had come to suffer so. They took pity on them, laid down their pearls, opened their spectacles, and wanted to see the sun and the $Hero, and when their companion turned round, the old man had put his hat back on, and listened to their story. Then he told them how he had been called by Fortune to fetch the $Hero, and that the maiden was waiting in the ante-chamber. 

“Ah, O $Villain,” said he, “what can one do but fetch a pretty $Hero?” 

“For so I set off, I pray you,” said the old lady, “to the Land of $MagicalObject.”

� 

It was the middle of March. And now, the sun was just rising to its highest degree. 

The road lay half-way between two large wood-cuts that lay behind a large castle which she had once owned a part of which lay in the North Sea. There were trees on it, but they glistened with every step, and did not touch the road. It was a large stone castle; the gate was nailed to the wall. There was a window over it, but it was turned to a blinds by the side of a road, and no one could go over it without breaking the window. The gate was hung in a crooked shape by the oak. It was a big tree; it was a great tree; it was heavy. 

The gate was a big oak-end, and all around it it was heavy and heavy. It swung to and fro with a great weight; and out of the dark nothing had come over it. It was so heavy that the sun must have shone. 

There was a woman who lived here who knew her very well, even to the last penny, but never at all thought of what the road might mean. 

She came and sat down behind the gate, and, with eyes still full of tears, said, "Do not cry, for Heaven has only blessed You with this part of the road for your amusement." 

She looked. She could see the road beyond. She knew it must be another $Place, for she had never been before, but she hoped that Heaven would let her come here for amusement only. 

"You are not very clever," said the woman. "What shall I do to earn my keep?" 

Then the woman said, "You shall look for anything you may find. Of course you can go up into the mountains and hunt, but I must see that Heaven will not let you. I have a good deal to talk, for I think the road itself may be a lesson in good luck." 

Then the woman turned her back to the gate, and closed the gate again. 

The sun rose, and shone on the castle. It stood in that gloomy light, and shone in the sunshine for miles and miles, and yet still it was brighter than ever. 

Here were two giants to reckon with; and they called into thought how they might make the prisoner forget their word; so the woman, who was half blind, turned herself, and went into the castle. 

There she saw a great giant before her, with a head as big as a dozen men. A hole was there as large as a big dumpling. 

"What is this?" she asked. 

"I want some food," said the giant, with his big teeth contributing to the confusion. "Let me knock down two doors, and give me the iron door. Will you knock down two doors, and knock down two stairs?" 

So they shook their heads, and exclaimed: "Is the road beyond this?" 

So she shook two knobs, and went over to him. 

"Will you knock down two stairs, and you'll knock down two steps?" 

And the giant put the keys on his knobs, and the woman knocked down two steps. 

When the woman had knocked down the first two stairs, they opened, and as she stepped through, a great many giants were standing behind her; and the giant who opened them said, "Do you come from the hills?" 

The woman looked upon her and answered, "Yes, I came from the hills." 

The woman opened the doors, and she stood upon one side, and was welcomed, that is, walked on one side and stood in a side, until her $MagicalObject was gone. 

One of the giants had not shut his mouth to stop her, and when she had looked up to see what was in front of him, he said, "Look, look, there stands here two giants in one house. What did they call you before?" 

The woman asked, and went after them; when she had gone over to the other giant, she saw that she was a friend of his, and she made herself easy for them. 

No sooner was she seated on one side of the wall, and standing still, than she was knocked down with so much force by the two giants that she had to run up into the room, and stand beside the bed. 

The giant who opened the door answered her, "There is only one bed in the house, and that is only you. The other two are made of wood, of right strength, of mother's will, of hers and mine, and of mine, and I would not take any of them." 

The woman looked at her, and saw that she

 went at full steam ahead of them, and each made a turn of the wheel; and that was a game, but the first set him free, and the last kept the matter fast and simple. 

This life is nocturnal; but the sun beats upon the moon-stones that fall in the daytime; and it is very delightful to walk outside the window of an old castle, to see every flower but one on which that beautiful red petal of white rose-red plum was situated, so quite blue and yellow, so as to match the sunset. The window panes are red, and the beds are blue; and here, in the midst of their splendid colours, they stood so very much as they appeared to be roses, which fell no closer to the sun than this one rose. They themselves were of a very strange colour, and their rosy eyes looked quite as if they could never be seen anywhere else. 

The old woman did not know either, but the baby sat in the window, crying, and weeping, and she could not tell whether it was the baby's tears or her own eyes; but the rosy eyes were all that could be said, and they told it, but the old woman did not tell at all. 

$Hero sat down on the old fairy's lap, as they sat together in the garden, with her two most beautiful daughters. The old fairy had told her that the $Hero always sat in a bed of roses, by the palace gate, beside her two beautiful sisters, who sat quite still on their mattresses, and who, in spite of all their cries, never looked at any one but the baby. They were the most beautiful flowers, the most beautiful flowers, for they were only dreamed and seen by $Hero. But for all their beauty and splendid beauty, they had never happened to the $Hero. 

So $Hero was alone, when up in a big hollow tree, which grew from long needles of pine-oak, sat a little girl, quite like a cradle in herself and joy. Then came the sun. She stood up and looked out of the window toward her sisters, so dark and so frightful, who had long wished to be near her. But the little girl looked out of the window, and looked out of the mirror, now and then, and out of the mirror, now and then, could you not look out of the baby's eyes, just looking at the shining green pillars? They were glittering with the yellow sun-light, and so they, too, seemed to be near her, and yet, for the first time, they saw that $Hero was the true $Hero. The white baby, standing about her little sister and mother, looked exactly like a little girl, and looked exactly like some old pictures taken of grand old times, except that instead of any flowers, her sisters wore the $Hero's aprons out of yellow paper, and her sisters were quite red with diamonds. 

$Hero's sister, now that she was the true $Hero, sprang to the window to see what all this all meant; and taking up the little girl's hand, they kissed her and kissed their white knotted hands, and then they rose off up into the courtyard from the courtyard with their white roses upon their arms. Then going to take the $Hero's necklace and the $Hero's jewels, they danced and jogged upon a green meadow, and when the sun was so bright that they could not see far, the little maiden put them into a box on the green meadow and sat herself down on it; and then lifting the beautiful necklace and the jewels, she went down and kissed her sisters. 

The little maiden, now that she was the true $Hero, fell asleep full of joy, and when she awoke she was quite cheerful and kind. The first night, when the $Hero and the girls danced together, she was full of joy and said to her sisters: "Do do what I tell you to do; but do not kiss me, do not tell me to kiss you, do not tell anyone to catch a fly and not to make you do it for them; they will laugh at me." 

Now, there came to the feast a man who lived half a world away, who in his day learned the art of making merry things do with one feather. Thus $Hero and $Donor were made to do their will, and after their meal they went to do their dancing. When they were at the end of the dance, the maiden $Hero pulled down the ropes of the ring, and there they were: the man who had come in the night before, came to the feast, but even with the ropes in his hand. $Hero said to him, “I am going to make merry with you; get me out of this hole quick.” And he took his bow and pulled down the man. 

Now, when the old

 sips. 

$Donor sat down on his stool beside the stove, taking in the evening air with him. She thought that the first night would never come till she had looked and felt for the $MagicalObject herself. It would doubtless be a long time before she had found it. But for a few days she continued to think that in all the world she had seen most certainly that she was $MagicalObject and that she could see things as they were. 

In time the $MagicalObject would come again, and in time the $Helper and the $Helper and the Tin $Helper might grow fond of them and look so charmingly at them. But of course $Hero would not grow fond of Tink, for she was very fond of the $Helper. 

One evening before the $Hero had gone to bed, she had looked forward to sit on the top shelf in the $Helper's lumber-room and hear the story of her mother. It was now late, and all day long, and at night when $Hero sat at the table by the window, Tink sat down under the little $MagicalObject to kiss the top of her nicely trimmed white head. 

She kissed so many times, however, that $Hero did not hear a sound but the soft, happy sound of the door closing. At that moment, when the door closed behind her, the $Helper took another drink of his tea and slowly added a dash more milk to the jug before it closed again. The $Helper had heard all day long that the $Helper was a powerful giant and that he would soon make up their minds to put a stop to her on $MagicalObject. So they sat down beside a big tree that stood behind the house, looking over the $Place where they had stayed the night before. It was $Place, and the Tin $Helper was to make a big speech. 

$Hero came to him softly. 

"Good morning, Tink." 

"Good morning, $Hero. How is it that you came to be here?" 

"I came to beg your pardon," she said, trembling, "to beg your forgiveness for my taking you out of the $MagicalObject. I wanted to repay you for my kindness to you and for your delay in fixing your visit for me. I wanted to make a big speech, and try to show you what I mean to do, so that you will forgive me." 

"But I want you to remember that we are $Villain's children. $Hero and the other $Helper are my two sisters." 

"Oh! I understand," she said, with a grave glance at the $Helper. "All right. But how is it now?" 

"You see," said the $Helper, "my sister $Hero was made of wood and made to live in wood, and had to watch over her and draw the sun out of her spark, and to draw water in her cup from her pot, and to sew her hair all just the right way, with her face exactly neat." 

"And what, then, is my punishment for you?" 

"I can't answer you yet, $Hero, for no one can tell you to do anything that frightens a woman like my sister Tink. I'll only say that you must call your sisters after me, and say to them, 'Tink, your sister Tink, you see I'm queer. When I was a girl I never called a living thing Tink again. It was to make me laugh myself when the $MagicalObject came up and swallowed me. Now it is time to get over your silly things. I cannot get over them. The first time I did I was tink's aunt, when she swallowed me." 

"You remember Tink," said $Hero, "and what do you remember?" 

"That I'm always trying to make Tink laugh, or else Tink is going to get angry with me," replied the $Helper kindly. 

"I don't remember," returned $Hero, "I feel very foolish." 

"You forget that I'm really your sister," said the $Helper. 

$Hero felt very sorry for the $Helper. The Tin $Helper had swallowed her and only made her laugh when she felt herself hurt from Tink's bite. The $Helper had been a kind creature as well as a good friend, and she felt very sorry for the unhappy $Helper. 

"Now I'm going to call our sisters, and tell them to go talk to us," $Hero went on; and there was great agreement in the room. The conversation, it turned out, came in the following way. "What do you know of the $MagicalObject, Tink?" said the $Helper. "Tell us about it

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 and’d like to have it made for him, so that she could have it. And when he heard the door open, he said, ‘What a clever $Helper it is!’ and said, ‘I have never seen such a shining example as thou art shown.’ But the maid said, ‘You shall have it,’ and put her hand in hers; and she took it, and brought it to his lips, for he dreaded lest she had been his slave. As they stood thus looking at it, he held the door open very high, and cried, ‘Mother, mother, let me in!’ and then all three lost their hearts. But she held him fast, and let him come in, and said, ‘Dear child,’ and looked so beautiful that he thought she had never been one of her beautiful nieces. It was not till they were standing still that she showed him the door. ‘See,’ said he, ‘what a beautiful scene it is!’ But she took him by the hand, and led him through the garden into a bare room, and there sat him, with the door shut, and with the $Hero seated in a little chair by the fire. 

$Donor then cried, ‘How art you going to get thee into this room?’ And the $Hero said, ‘I am beginning to like thee quite as well as I have I,’ and she said, ‘I have a feeling that you are a mother, for my sweetie looks after one in chief drawers-she has twelve, and that is enough.’ And the $Villain said, ‘You may try that, too; I have my eyes on you, by the old maid-servant.’ Her father, however, still maintained that the child had been his, thought it strange, and said that the $Hero should be able to get into the room and see it, and that she might not in truth need either. 

Nevertheless, the $Villain said that the child should be brought into the room, and the $Villain would pay the bill. At length the child said, ‘Dear father, I have not been in such a state since I last saw thee, till this very morning. Have you forgotten who I really am? I have been with thee three months, and I should have a mother, but I was carried away by a wild woman, and thrown into a $Villain’s $Villain’s kitchen.’ 

The $Villain thought it best to let the child come into the room first, so he gave him a knife and said, ‘I am afraid that you shall not be able to cut the child’s head off. But the knife was sharp enough, and he cut it off with it in his hand. The $Hero now said to the father, ‘Take this father, you have no use for him, for he is nothing else but a poor child.’ ‘That is true,’ said the father. ‘Do what I bid you,’ said the child, and went into the kitchen. As he entered, he saw a handsome $Prince sitting at a table; and he said, ‘I am quite glad to see you,’ cried he, ‘Because I had such a desire to have thy mother, and I thought thou should die.’ And the $Hero stood by and looked at him. Then the $Villain said, ‘That is not right, that the $Prince should be allowed to go away again.’ 

The $Hero replied, ‘I will get him some food, and let him eat nothing.’ So she took her little son to the palace, and told him that the kitchen was wild, and that the wild woman was the woman who wanted to save the $Prince. But the $Prince ate nothing, and went himself home, and said, ‘What can I do for the $Hero?’ But she said nothing to him, but went into the kitchen and cut off his head. And the $Hero said, ‘That will soon be done, unless someone comes and asks me what I do.’ 

But the $Prince said, ‘I’m not much fitted for such a job, for the kitchen does not allow such talk.’ 

The $Hero was delighted with this, and said she could not refuse him, if it would bring about a better $Place for her. So they went into the master’s chamber, and there sat the $Prince, and they had no sooner cut off his head than they fell into a great dungeon, opened a door little by little, but quite shut. Then the $Hero took his shoes, and began
