# ThinkingMachines
Thinking Machines is a semester project at the Media Design Master, HEAD – Genève, in which students will revisit the concept of “personal computers” in the age of neural networks and explore how the creation of personalised assistants can reshape their creative workflow.

## notes for Bindery.js and p5.js

the p5.js canvas must be placed in a ```<p></p>``` tag.
Each tag must have a unique identifier noted ```id="name-of-the-identifier"```

example:
``` html
<p id = "p5-container-1"> </ p>
<p id = "p5-container-2"> </ p>
<p id = "p5-container-3"> </ p>
...
```
